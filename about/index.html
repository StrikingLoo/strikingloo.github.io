        <h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	I'm Luciano Strika, a Computer Science student, Data Scientist and eternal Geek.
	I like reading Machine Learning papers or articles, doing my best effort to implement them, and then posting my results in the internet so that people tell me everything I did wrong and help me learn. That's mostly what I did in my <a href='https://datastuff.tech'>previous blog.</a>. 
	However I felt like I didn't have enough experience in the whole web development side of things, and wanted to try out something like this. I also wanted one of these cute GitHub websites every developer seems to be getting.
	So I made this. It's pretty likely that I'll use this website to write about everything <i>except</i> Data Science/Machine Learning. Probably just whatever comes to my mind.
	Feel free to hit me up in any of the media linked below. We can have a chat, iterate your world domination plans, or maybe you could hire me as a tech writer/ Machine Learning consultant. Your call.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	I'm Luciano Strika, a Computer Scientist, Data Scientist and complete geek.
	</p><p>
	I spend my time reading Machine Learning papers or books, programming, and studying Japanese. 
	Once a week, I share projects and ideas that I think are beautiful, as an essay in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. 
	I used to post Machine Learning tutorials in my <a href='https://medium.com/@strikingLoo'>previous blog</a>.
	</p><p>
	In my free time I also watch industrial amounts of anime and manga, and love reading books (both fiction and non-fiction).
	</p><p>

	I built this site. Partly because I felt like I hadn't done any web development in a long while and wanted to give it a try, and partly because I feel that maintaining and tending to a website bit by bit, making it more beautiful and cleaner with every alteration, until it becomes a great place to hang out and read, sounds like the kind of long-term project I would be happy to put my energy into.
	</p><p>
	I haven't written in the blog a lot yet, but I keep a pretty neat <a href="/wiki">Digital Garden</a> with evergreen notes, that also doubles as my personal wiki and paper notes repository. Give it a look!

	</p><p>Some of my intellectual influences are <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">Scott Alexander</a> and <a href="https://www.gwern.net/">Gwern</a>. Like old masters, they showed me how great a website can be. More directly, I was inspired to start writing again by <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">Guzey</a> and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2015/09/03/nycblogclub/">Tom Critchlow</a>.

	Feel free to hit me up in any of the media linked below. We can have a chat, iterate your world domination plans, or maybe exchange memes. Your call.

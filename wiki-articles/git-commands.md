Just a series of git commands I found useful. 

If they're here, it means I didn't come accross all of them in the same place, and I chose to bunch them all together for future ease of recollection.

```git config --global alias.cm 'commit -m' ```

```git config --global user.name strikingLoo ``` 

Considered a lot less secure (for obvious reasons) so don't use this for passwords.

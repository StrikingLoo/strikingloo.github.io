### Loneliness

Researchers are increasingly recognizing loneliness as a major health problem. A recent study, for example, found that **loneliness has more than doubled among older people** since the Covid-19 pandemic began.

Past research has also shown older people who experience loneliness have a **higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia**. Lonely people **get sick more often**, and **take longer to get over infections**. Loneliness also **increases blood pressure** and levels of **stress hormones**. Socially isolated people are more likely to be **depressed**, suffer from **memory loss**, and use **alcohol and drugs**. Likewise, evidence suggests that loneliness contributes to **aging** in a number of ways, and leads to reduced longevity. In fact, the health risks of loneliness are**equivalent to those related to obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day**.

"The four top-level categories of P.A.R.A. — Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives — are designed to facilitate this process of forwarding knowledge through time.

- By placing a note in a project folder, you are essentially scheduling it for review on the short time horizon of an individual project.
- Notes in area folders are scheduled for less frequent review, whenever you evaluate that area of your work or life.
- Notes in resource folders stand ready for review if and when you decide to take action on that topic.
- Notes in archive folders are in “cold storage,” available if needed but not scheduled for review at any particular time. " source: [https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/](progressive summarization @fortelabs)

- Think lossy, context vs discoverability trade-off.
- Take key fragments, summarize them, iterate.

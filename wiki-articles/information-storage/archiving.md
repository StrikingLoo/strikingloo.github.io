## 'Thoughts On' Journal
"There are certain subjects in your life you think about a lot. People, places, hobbies, health, plans, finances.

For each subject that you might have ongoing thoughts about, start a separate “Thoughts On” journal. Whenever you have some thoughts on this subject, open up that file, write today’s date, then start writing."

"I find it so useful to keep my thoughts on each subject together, because I can see my past thoughts and current thoughts in one place. I can see how my thoughts on this subject have evolved or keep repeating. Sometimes I think I have a new thought on a subject, so I open up the file and write it down, then afterwards I see I had that same thought a year ago and had forgotten about it. **If you care about your thoughts, keep them.**"

[Daily Journal, Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/dj)

## Commonplace Books

Commonplace books (or *commonplaces*) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century. Such books are essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. **Each one is unique to its creator's particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts**, sometimes accompanied by the compiler's responses. They became significant in Early Modern Europe.

"Commonplace" is a translation of the Latin term *locus communis* (from Greek tópos koinós, see literary topos) which means "a general or common topic", such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as John Milton's example. Scholars now understand them to include manuscripts in which an individual collects material which have a common theme, such as ethics, or exploring several themes in one volume. Commonplace books are private collections of information, but they are not diaries or travelogues.

In 1685 the English Enlightenment philosopher John Locke wrote a treatise in French on commonplace books, translated into English in 1706 as A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books, "in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Commonplace books, it must be stressed, are not journals, which are chronological and introspective.

**Memory systems can be used to build genuine conceptual understanding**, not just learn facts: we can achieve this in part through the aspiration to virtuoso card writing, and in part through a narrative embedding of spaced repetition that gradually builds context and understanding.

**Mnemonic techniques such as memory palaces are great, but not versatile enough to build genuine conceptual understanding**: Such techniques are very specialized, and emphasize artificial connections, not the inherent connections present in much conceptual knowledge. The mnemonic techniques are, however, useful for bootstrapping knowledge with an ad hoc structure.

**Memory is far more important than people tend to think**: It plays a role in nearly every part of cognition, including problem-solving, creative work, and meta-cognition. The flip side is that memory systems themselves want to grow into other types of tools – tools for reading, tools for problem-solving, tools for creating, tools for attention management. That said, we don’t yet know what memory systems want to be. To reiterate: memory systems are in their infancy.

**Capture everything**: Do not assume your brain will remember anything. Write it down ASAP. Use whatever will let you capture it quickest, whether that's pen and paper or a digital solution.

**Review and process**: Make sure you actually look at the things you wrote down regularly and organize it. If it was an idea you need to act on (e.g. a topic for a blog post, or a reminder to look up a particular concept), add it to your task manager. If it was a thought for reference, add it to your 'second brain'/note-taking/archive system, and add tags so you can find it easily later. Once processed, archive or delete the item from your capture system.

"I have been using plain text documents since 2001.
I just make a new file with a YYYY-MM format and dump everything in there, and on the next month I start a new file. I keep them all in 1 folder.

It's really simple to use and very searchable with grep. I like it because it's all offline and doesn't get in the way.

It becomes a brain dump of interesting links, notes about certain things I'm doing or whatever else I feel is worth jotting down at the time."

## Zettelkasten

> "Notes (both your notes and highlights) should be **turned into explicit form as soon as possible.** As of now, your notes are implicit at best, and would therefore lose meaning & context quickly.

Think of it like jotting down “pencil” to remind yourself to return a pencil to your classmate. After a couple of days, seeing that reminder “pencil” won’t make sense anymore. Otherwise, if you put it this way: “Return pencil to Sara” then you won’t have any problems no matter how much time has passed.

The point is, every bit of implicit-ness must be stated clearly in words. (You can say this actually future-proofs your notes)"

" To counteract [the bias of being overconfident about your memory], **write as if you’re writing for others.** If only the current you can understand what you’re saying in your notes, then the notes won’t be usable in the future. Technically speaking, you are going to become a different person in the future, so you might as well write as if you’re trying to talk to someone else. "
-- [LeanAnki](https://leananki.com/zettelkasten-method-smart-notes/)

As a summary, the Zettelkasten method follows a workflow with three steps:
- **Capture** (get input from your books, articles or whatever you're consuming, and persist it)
- **Elaborate** (add your own opinions, summaries, headlines, bolding, etc.)
- **Connect** (link from one note to another. The point is to make that new note easy to find in your web of notes, so link from the old ones.

Zettelkasten relies more heavily on linking than tags/searching. This is because of the use of smaller, more granulated Zettels which interlink to represent a "thought trail" (a linked list of Zettels). 

In my case I prefer big chunky notes + search, but we'll see.

### Having a short-term and a long-term cache with nightly batch processing
"In Taking Smart Notes, Luhmann is described as **transferring the important thoughts from the day into Zettel every evening**. Sheffler, on the other hand, keeps a gap of at least 24 hours between taking down engagement notes and deciding what belongs in the long-term store. A gap of time allows the initial excitement over an idea to pass, so that only the things which still seem important the next day get into long-term notes. He also points out that this system enforces a small amount of spaced repetition, making it more likely that content is recalled later."

The author himself remarks he doesn't do this, and writes directly in the zettelkasten instead.

## Johnny Decimal

From [Johnny Decimal, A system to organise projects](https://johnnydecimal.com/)

> Nobody can find anything any more, it’s time to get organised.

- Step 1: Divide everything into ten things.
- Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again. Categories are the key.

We give each category a number. Before the decimal: category id. After the decimal: auto-increasing file ID (for each new one you create). 

None of the areas or categories overlap. There’s only one place anything can ever be.
An important restriction of the system is that you’re not allowed to create any folders inside a Johnny.Decimal folder.

This means that you’ll never get lost in layers upon layers of folders. It also makes you create quite specific folders for each thing, ensuring that you can always find what you want.

Easily tell people where things are.

That's a summary of what they suggest. Though I don't know if I'd go all in on the indexing by numbers wagon, I do like the idea of using a depth-2-at-most file tree for easy retrieval and to improve discoverability.

I think this is one of those things that sounds nice in theory but would be a nightmare to implement in practice, for any team bigger than 5 people. Just imagining trying to make the teams from different provinces adopt our same indexing system sounds like it would take 4 or 5 meetings, and somebody would still get it wrong on either end. It's a huge coordination problem.

But maybe a small squad system could work. 

## Hypertext

Let me introduce the word "hypertext" to mean a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.

It may contain summaries, or maps of its contents and their interrelations; it may contain annotations, additions and footnotes from scholars who have examined it. 

Let me suggest that such an object and
system, properly designed and administered, could have great potential for education, increasing the student's range of choices, his sense of freedom, his motivation, and his intellectual grasp. 

Such a system could grow indefinitely, gradually including more and more of the world's written knowledge.
However, its internal file structure would have to be built to accept growth, change and complex informational arrangements. The ELF is such a file structure.

## LYT

LYT is a way to take in, process, and link captured information in order to turn that information into knowledge, with the expressed purpose of bettering one's life. Though, a zettelkasten regularly benefits the user in the same way—far beyond its expressed purpose—LYT comes with a much taller order. What are beneficial byproducts in zettelkasten are centered in LYT. And, it's what's centered in LYT that drew Nick into new note-taking territory.

## Personal Knowledge Base by TKainRad

"Preserving information that is often needed but doesn’t fit in any proper documentation project.

In my case, these are things like the following:
- **Command-lines with multiple parameters, complex options, and paths**: I keep them in my notes so that I can quickly copy-paste them in the potentially distant future.
- **Instructions for tasks that will likely have to be repeated in the future**: for example setting up a development environment for a specific tech stack, deploying a project on a specific hosting service.
- **Questions:** Sometimes I think of a question that I would like to ask someone specific, who is not available at the moment. The question and its eventual answer are a nice use case for a note."

## P.A.R.A Methodology
"The four top-level categories of P.A.R.A. — Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives — are designed to facilitate this process of forwarding knowledge through time.

- By placing a note in a project folder, you are essentially scheduling it for review on the short time horizon of an individual project.
- Notes in area folders are scheduled for less frequent review, whenever you evaluate that area of your work or life.
- Notes in resource folders stand ready for review if and when you decide to take action on that topic.
- "Notes in archive folders are in “cold storage,” available if needed but not scheduled for review at any particular time." 
source: [progressive summarization @fortelabs](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/)

- Think lossy, context vs discoverability trade-off.
- Take key fragments, summarize them, iterate.

**Why**: Keep a list of problems you're interested in (I'm not really buying this one)

**What**: Raise the bar: does what you capture serve a purpose in one of your 12 (in our case N) problems? If so, keep. Else, discard.

**How**: PARA: 
- **Projects**: for projects with a clear deliverable and deadline,
- **Areas**: for ongoing study/actionable topics, like health, finances, etc. Here these guys make a distinction between public and private notes, therefore...
- **Resources**: Here's where you put interesting documents, quotes, tidbits and data that you'd like to show to other people, or consult afterwards. Typical notes you'd share with everyone. Public notes.
- Archive: for deprecated notes.
I don't completely like this system. Especially the archive part, but also it's mostly designed for writers or generators of content. This becomes more obvious once you read the next part:

The final piece of the puzzle. Once you have the information captured and organized, you need to actually do something with it. There are two parts to the **creation stage: divergence and convergence. Divergence** is where you take what you have captured and begin to **explore the ideas, extracting useful tidbits, and discovering the best** of what you have. **Convergence** is where you then **compile those best ideas into something structured and concrete** that you can send out into the world. And of course, there are several strategies for each.

So even though my main goal isn't writing or making content, I do believe extracting insights from data, or finding creative ways to connect different areas will prove useful, or at least fun. I'm keeping the idea of separating things into resources (shareable) and areas (personal), and also the idea of going through notes for convergence and divergence.

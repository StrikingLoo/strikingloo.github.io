"The four top-level categories of P.A.R.A. — Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives — are designed to facilitate this process of forwarding knowledge through time.

- By placing a note in a project folder, you are essentially scheduling it for review on the short time horizon of an individual project.
- Notes in area folders are scheduled for less frequent review, whenever you evaluate that area of your work or life.
- Notes in resource folders stand ready for review if and when you decide to take action on that topic.
- "Notes in archive folders are in “cold storage,” available if needed but not scheduled for review at any particular time." source: [https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/](progressive summarization @fortelabs)

- Think lossy, context vs discoverability trade-off.
- Take key fragments, summarize them, iterate.

"There are certain subjects in your life you think about a lot. People, places, hobbies, health, plans, finances.

For each subject that you might have ongoing thoughts about, start a separate “Thoughts On” journal. Whenever you have some thoughts on this subject, open up that file, write today’s date, then start writing."

"I find it so useful to keep my thoughts on each subject together, because I can see my past thoughts and current thoughts in one place. I can see how my thoughts on this subject have evolved or keep repeating. Sometimes I think I have a new thought on a subject, so I open up the file and write it down, then afterwards I see I had that same thought a year ago and had forgotten about it. **If you care about your thoughts, keep them.**"

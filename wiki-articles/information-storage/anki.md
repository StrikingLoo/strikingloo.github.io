## Helping Develop Virtuoso Skills with Personal Memory Systems
"As we'll see, Anki can be used to remember almost anything. That is, **Anki makes memory a choice**, rather than a haphazard event, to be left to chance. I'll discuss how to use Anki to understand research papers, books, and much else. And I'll describe numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.

I therefore have two rules of thumb. First, if memorizing a fact seems worth 10 minutes of my time in the future, then I do it. Second, and superseding the first, if a fact seems striking then into Anki it goes, regardless of whether it seems worth 10 minutes of my future time or not. The reason for the exception is that many of the most important things we know are things we're not sure are going to be important, but which our intuitions tell us matter. This doesn't mean we should memorize everything. But it's worth cultivating taste in what to memorize.

What can Anki be used for? I use Anki in all parts of my life. Professionally, I use it to **learn from papers and books; to learn from talks and conferences; to help recall interesting things learned in conversation; and to remember key observations made while doing my everyday work.** Personally, I use it to remember all kinds of facts relevant to my family and social life; about my city and travel; and about my hobbies. Later in the essay I describe some useful patterns of Anki use, and anti-patterns to avoid."

[Michael A. Nielsen, Augmenting Cognition](http://augmentingcognition.com)

His steps for making Anki cards on a paper (I guess they apply to book chapters too):
- First pass: add basic questions easily picked up from looking at the text (What is the win condition in this game?).
- Second pass: add conceptual or more complicated questions, which require a certain understanding of the text.
- Third pass: High level questions that require a deep understanding of the subject.

Note: for a single paper, Nielsen makes "several hundred" cards.

from [Karpathy's Biohacking Lite:](https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/)
"You might think that most of your energy output would come from movement, but in fact 1) your body is exceedingly efficient when it comes to movement, and 2) it is energetically unintuitively expensive to just exist."

"Glycogen, a branching polysaccharide of glucose found in your liver and skeletal muscle. The liver can store about 120 grams and the skeletal muscle about 400 grams. About 4 grams of glucose also circulates in your blood. Your body derives approximately ~4 kcal/g from full oxidation of glucose (adding up glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation), so if you do the math your glycogen battery stores about 2,000 kcal. This also happens to be roughly the base metabolic rate of an average adult, i.e. the energy just to “keep the lights on” for 24 hours."

"Collectively, this portion of energy expenditure is called the Base Metabolic Rate (BMR) and you burn this “for free” even if you slept the entire day. As an example, my BMR is somewhere around 1800kcal/day (a common estimate due to Mifflin St. Jeor for men is 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) + 5)."

"The main components of **Mediterranean diet** include:

- **Daily** consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats
- **Weekly** intake of fish, poultry, beans and eggs
- **Moderate** portions of dairy products
- **Limited** intake of red meat

Other important elements of the Mediterranean diet are sharing meals with family and friends, enjoying a glass of red wine and being physically active." [Source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801)

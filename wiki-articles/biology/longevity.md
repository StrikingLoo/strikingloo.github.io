Here goes anything interesting relating to longevity. Especially actionable advice.

## Blue Zones
_Source: [Blue Zones - National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125071/)._

The [Danish Twin Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02185763) established that only about 20% of how long the average person lives is dictated by our genes, whereas the other 80% is dictated by our lifestyle.

The 5 demographically confirmed, geographically defined areas (called **Blue Zones**) with the highest percentage of centenarians are:
- Loma Linda, CA, USA
- Nicoya, Costa Rica
- Sardinia, Italy
- Ikaria, Greece
- Okinawa, Japan

In those areas, people **reach age 100 at 10 times greater rates than in the United States.**

lifestyles of all Blue Zones residents shared 9 specific characteristics. These are called the **Power 9.**

To make it to age 100, it seems that a person must have to win the genetic lottery. However, **many individuals have the capacity to make it well into the early 90s and largely without chronic disease.** Blue Zones uncovered 9 evidence-based common denominators among the world’s centenarians that are believed to slow this aging process.

### Power 9

- **Move naturally.** The world’s longest-lived people do not pump iron, run marathons, or join gyms. Instead, they **live in environments that constantly nudge them into moving without thinking about it.** They grow gardens and do not have mechanical conveniences for house and yard work.
- **Purpose.** The Okinawans call it いきがい and the Nicoyans call it _plan de vida_; for both, it translates to “why I wake up in the morning.” Knowing your **sense of purpose** is worth up to 7 years of extra life expectancy.
・**Downshift.** Even people in the Blue Zones experience stress. Stress leads to chronic inflammation, associated with every major age-related disease. What the world’s longest-lived people have that others do not are **routines to shed that stress.**
- **80% Rule.** Hara hachi bu —the Okinawan 2500-year old Confucian _mantra said before meals_ reminds them to **stop eating when their stomachs are 80% full.** The 20% gap between not being hungry and feeling full could be the difference between losing weight or gaining it. People in the Blue Zones eat their smallest meal in the late afternoon or early evening, and then, they do not eat any more the rest of the day.
- **Plant slant.** Beans, including fava, black, soy, and lentils, are the cornerstone of most centenarian diets. Meat —mostly pork— is eaten on average only 5 times per month. Serving sizes are 3 to 4 oz, about the size of a deck of cards.
- **Loved ones first.** Successful centenarians in the Blue Zones put their families first. This means keeping aging parents and grandparents nearby or in the home (it lowers disease and mortality rates of children in the home too.). They commit to a life partner (which can add up to 3 years of life expectancy) and invest in their children with time and love.
- **Right tribe.** The world’s longest lived people chose —or were born into— **social circles that supported healthy behaviors**, Okinawans created moais—groups of 5 friends that committed to each other for life. Research from the Framingham Studies shows that smoking, obesity, happiness, and even [loneliness](/wiki-articles/psychology/loneliness) are contagious.

The other two are Wine & Religion (which I will assume have more to do with correlation than causation, though religion may help in the right tribe, move and purpose components).

Some actionable advice mentioned in the article: putting a bowl of fruit on the counter, serving food at the stove and not on the table, using hand tools for yard work, and many more. Policy goals would include encouraging fruit and vegetables consumption and walking, and discourage candy and fast food consumption.

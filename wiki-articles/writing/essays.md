From [LeanAnki, Zettelkasten Method](https://leananki.com/zettelkasten-method-smart-notes/), I see he has this simple method for essay writing: 
- Write about a problem in detail.
- Write about the solution.

Of course an extra step would be 'make sure you include actionable advice'. I like this approach, it's simple and goes straight to the point. I like the way he combines it with note-taking/zettelkastening by linking zettels that have to do with the problem, and others that have to do with the solution.

This could be a way to write essays more freely, without being bound to the tutorial structure.

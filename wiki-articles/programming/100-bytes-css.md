From [swyix.io](https://www.swyx.io/css-100-bytes/) who in turn cites HN's @JoshuaRLi as a source, a small snippet of CSS to begin any style with:

```
html {
  max-width: 70ch;
  padding: 3em 1em;
  margin: auto;
  line-height: 1.75;
  font-size: 1.25em;
}
```

This adds a nice space between lines, uses a readable font size, and guarantees some margin on the sides of the page, while giving enough space for text.

# Honorifics (keigo):

_keigo_ (敬語), fall under three main categories:

- _sonkeigo_ (尊敬語) - respectful language.
- _kenjōgo_ (謙譲語) - humble language (or "modest language").
- _teineigo_ (丁寧語) - polite language. (just -masu-kei)

Linguistically, the former two are referent honorifics, used for someone being talked ​**about** ​, and the
last is an addressee honorific, used for someone being talked ​**to**.

## Respectful language, sonkeigo

Respectful language, ​_sonkeigo_, is a special form or alternate word used when talking about
superiors and customers. It is not used to talk about oneself. For example, when a Japanese
hairdresser or dentist requests their client to take a seat, they say _o kake ni natte kudasai_ ​to mean
"please sit down". However, they would use the verb ​_suwaru_ ​rather than ​_o kake ni naru_ to refer to
themselves sitting down. The respectful version of language can only be used to refer to others.

It is characterized by lengthy polite expressions.

**Common verbs may be replaced by more polite alternative verbs**​, for example ​_suru_ by
_nasaru_​, or ​_hanasu_ by _ossharu_ when the subject is a person of respect. Some of these
transformations are many-to-one: _iku_, _kuru_, and _iru_ all become ​_irassharu_, and _taberu_ and ​_nomu_ both become ​_meshiagaru_.

**Verbs may also be changed to respectful forms**. One respectful form is a modification of the verb
with a prefix and a polite suffix. For example, _yomu_ becomes _o-yomi ni naru_ ​, with the **prefix**
**_o-_** **added to the i-form of the verb** ​, **and the verb ending** ​**_ni naru_**. The ​**verb ending** ​**_-(r)areru_**​ **can
also be used, such as** **_yomareru_**.

**Nouns also undergo substitution to express respect**. The normal Japanese word for person,
_hito_ ​, 人, becomes _kata_ ​, 方, in respectful language. Thus a customer would normally be expected to
be referred to as a _kata_ rather than a _hito_.

## Humble language ​ (kenjōgo)

In general, humble language is used when describing one's actions or the actions of a person in
one's in-group to others such as customers in business. Humble language tends to imply that one's
actions are taking place in order to assist the other person.

Humble language (kenjōgo) is similar to respectful language, in **substituting verbs with other
forms**. For example: **suru becomes itasu, and morau becomes itadaku**. These two verbs are
also seen in set phrases such as dō itashimashite andいただきます.

Similar to respectful language, **verbs can also change their form by adding a prefix and the verb
"suru" or "itasu".** For example, _motsu_ becomes _o mochi shimasu_. The use of humble forms
may imply doing something for the other person; thus a Japanese person might offer to carry
something for someone else by saying _o mochi shimasu_. This type of humble form also appears in
the set phrase _o matase shimashita_ ​, "I am sorry to have kept you waiting".

Even more politely, the form _motasete_ **_itadaku_** literally means "​ **humbly be allowed to** carry". This
phrase would be used to express the idea that "I will carry it if you please."

## Bottom line:

While keeping tense:

**sonkeigo (honorific):** o- (i-form) - ni naru

**kenjōgo (humble):** o- (i-form) - suru / itasu (humbler)

Unless it’s an irregular verb, in which case, see chart above.

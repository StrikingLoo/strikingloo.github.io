## Chapter 1: Introduction

The last joint in your finger is about 1000 cells long. A similar proportion to how many grains of rice fit in a room. The same way, the quantity of proteins that fit in a cell is also around 1M.

However, a protein moves through a cell (in a completely random walk) at about a million times its own length every second.

*"You might ask how anything ever gets done in this chaotic world. It
is true that the motion is random, but it is also true that the motion is
very fast compared to the motion in our familiar world.*

*Random, diffusive motion is fast enough to perform most of the tasks in the cell. Each molecule simply bumps around until it finds the right place.*

*To get an idea of how fast this motion is, imagine a typical bacterial
cell, and place an enzyme at one end and a sugar
molecule at the other. They will bump around and wander through the
whole cell, encountering many molecules along the way. On average,
though, **it will only take about a second for those two molecules to
bump into each other at least once.** This is truly remarkable: this means
that any molecule in a typical bacterial cell, during its chaotic journey
through the cell, will encounter almost every other molecule in a
matter of seconds."*

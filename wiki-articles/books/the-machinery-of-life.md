## Chapter 1: Introduction

The last joint in your finger is about 1000 cells long. A similar proportion to how many grains of rice fit in a room. The same way, the quantity of proteins that fit in a cell is also around 1M.

However, a protein moves through a cell (in a completely random walk) at about a million times its own length every second.

*"You might ask how anything ever gets done in this chaotic world. It
is true that the motion is random, but it is also true that the motion is
very fast compared to the motion in our familiar world.*

*Random, diffusive motion is fast enough to perform most of the tasks in the cell. Each molecule simply bumps around until it finds the right place.*

*To get an idea of how fast this motion is, imagine a typical bacterial
cell, and place an enzyme at one end and a sugar
molecule at the other. They will bump around and wander through the
whole cell, encountering many molecules along the way. On average,
though, **it will only take about a second for those two molecules to
bump into each other at least once.** This is truly remarkable: this means
that any molecule in a typical bacterial cell, during its chaotic journey
through the cell, will encounter almost every other molecule in a
matter of seconds."*


## Chapter 2

*"Modern cells use four basic plans for combining atoms to make
molecular machines. Whereas our familiar machines are built of
metal, wood, plastic, and ceramic, the nanoscale machinery of cells
is built of protein, nucleic acid, lipid, and polysaccharide. Each of
these plans has a unique chemical personality ideally suited to a
different role in the cell. Two basic concepts are needed to understand
how this chemical personality is manifested: chemical **complementarity** and **hydrophobicity**."*

*The large molecular machines in cells take advantage of both of these
properties. They often have oddly shaped surfaces that use hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges to find molecules with complementary shapes.
They often have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions that interact
differently with water. Different patterns of these regions cause molecules to act in novel ways when dissolved in water.*

The book classifies molecules into 4 categories, which have distinct properties:

- Nucleic acids
- Proteins
- Lipids
- Polysaccharides

**Nucleic Acids** :  Each nucleotide is composed of a base (A, T, C or G), which includes the hydrogen-bonding atoms held together in the perfect orientation in a rigid ring, and a sugar-phosphate group, which is used to link the nucleotides together.

Nucleic acids, are too limited in structure to perform the
many tasks in the daily life of a cell. The chemistry of the four bases,
although **perfect for information transfer**, are too similar to allow the
construction of the varied machines needed to perform thousands of
different chemical and mechanical reactions. Instead, proteins are used
in this capacity.

**Proteins**: Like nucleic acids, proteins are long molecular chains,
but instead of using four chemically similar nucleotides, proteins are
built of 20 different amino acids, each with a different size and chemical
character. They can serve multiple functions: some jut take a certain shape, some move and rotate, some are catalysts for a chemical reaction, moving atoms around.

The final shape of the folded protein is completely predetermined by the order of amino acids in the protein chain. In water, proteins tend to fold to expose hidrophilic aminoacids and cover hydrophobic ones.

A typical bacterium builds several thousand different types of proteins, each with a different function. Our own cells build about 30,000 different kinds, ranging in size from small protein hormones like glucagon, which has only 29 amino acids, to huge proteins like titin, which has over 34,000 amino acids.

Side fun fact: **antibodies are proteins**.

**Lipids**: Individually, lipids are tiny molecules, but when grouped together,
they form the largest structures of the cell. 

When placed in water, lipid molecules aggregate to form huge waterproof sheets. These sheets are used to enclose cells, forming the primary boundary separating the inside of the cell from the environment. They are also used to build compartments inside cells, such as the nucleus and the mitochondria. The unusual interaction of lipids with water makes them so useful. **Lipids, known commonly as fats and oils, are composed of a small hydrophilic ‘‘head’’ connected to two or three long hydrophobic ‘‘tails.’’**

In cells, the lipids aggregate to form a lipid bilayer: a
continuous sheet composed of two layers of aligned lipids.
All the tails pack side-by-side in the center and the heads are displayed
on the two faces, comfortable in the surrounding water.

Since lipid bilayers are composed of so many separate molecules,
they are dynamic and fluid. Each individual molecule rotates like a
top, and its hydrophobic tails wag and flail. Lipids also slide rapidly
past one another, always staying in the sheet, but randomly migrating
sideways. Since they are so fluid, lipid bilayers make the perfect skin
for cells. The membrane is flexible and bends easily to meet the
demands of the cell.

Pure lipid bilayers, however, are rarely found in modern cells. After
all, a perfect barrier would seal the cell away from food and nutrients,
and seal in waste materials. To solve this problem, cells build a variety
of specialized proteins that are inserted into the membrane. 


**Polysaccharides**: Long chains of sugars, used by organisms to make resilient and malleable structures like cellulose (wood, paper), insect carapaces or exoskeletons (chitin), and structural material in general.

## Chapter 3

"To make things even more challenging, cells must also be able to make all of their component molecular machines using only the resources that are available in the local environment. Think of the magnitude of this accomplishment. Many bacteria are able to build all of their own molecules from the a few simple raw materials like carbon dioxide, oxygen, and ammonia. A single bacterial cell knows how to build several thousand types of proteins, including motors, girders, toxins, catalysts, and construction machinery. This cell also builds hundreds of RNA molecules with different orderings of nucleotides, as well as a diverse collection of lipids, sugar polymers, and a bewildering collection of exotic small molecules. All of these different molecules must be created from scratch, using only the molecules that the cell eats, drinks, and breathes."

> At a rate of about 20 amino acids per second, an average protein takes about 20 seconds to build.

"As with the breakdown of sugar, molecular machines perform  energetic processes in small steps. Chemical energy is obtained through reactions of single molecules. Electrochemical energy is stored by moving individual ions, light is captured one photon at a time, and electrons are moved one-by-one along a string of molecular electron carriers. This allows a level of control, and efficiency, that is rarely seen in our familiar macroscale world."

## Chapter 4

About E. Coli, a very common, easy to grow and fast growing bacteria that's been widely studied (with its whole genome and proteinome mapped).

The outer membrane also anchors many *fimbriae*. These long, thin protein complexes are extruded piece-by-piece through special gateway proteins in
the outer membrane. Fimbriae have sticky ends, and when the bacterium finds an amenable place to rest, they glue it in place. The type of
fimbriae made by a particular strain is important. The fimbriae of
pathogenic bacteria allow them to attach to human cells and resist
attack by the cells of immune system.

Many important antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacterial cells by attacking the enzymes that build the peptidoglycan layer. When treated with penicillin, bacterial cells lose their
shape and ultimately explode under the osmotic pressure.

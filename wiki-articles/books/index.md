title: Book reviews and notes

Every time I read a non-fiction book, I will add all the excerpts and quotes I found interesting to a note, in addition to my summaries or opinions if I think they're relevant.

In that way, this section of the wiki is similar to a [commonplace book](/wiki-articles/information-storage/archiving#commonplace-books).

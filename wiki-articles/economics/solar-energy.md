[Weâ€™re going to need a lot of solar panels](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2022/07/22/were-going-to-need-a-lot-of-solar-panels)

These guys made a machine that turns the carbon from CO2 + hydrogen from water (split using solar energy) into methane or other hydrocarbons.

"Electricity so cheap that in an ever growing number of markets it now makes more sense to turn solar electricity into hydrocarbons, than to burn hydrocarbons to make electricity."

**[Wright's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects)** describes the tendency of some products to get cheaper with a growing manufacturing rate. It is not guaranteed by the laws of physics, but rather describes the outcome of a positive feedback loop, where a lower cost increases demand, increases revenue, increases investment, increases cognitive effort, and further lowers cost.

Since 2011 there has been an acceleration of production growth rate *and* an increase in the learning rate, such that the cost decline is now 30-40% per doubling. [vs 20% per doubling before].

[Solar Energy is extremely cheap](https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/) predicts solar being cheaper than existing fossil power plants by 2030.

3000 Quads is roughly 300 TW of solar generation capacity, occupying about **5% of Earth's land surface area**, and split between roof top installations in cities and dedicated plants on nearby less developed land. For comparison, agriculture uses 18% of Earth's land surface area, and largely uninhabited deserts are 33%. Ultra low cost solar power will be **[ground mounted](https://www.erthos.com/)**, and ideally rolled off a spool onto the ground similar to **[chemical-free plasticulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticulture)** today. Synthetic fuel byproducts include oxygen and water, so limited direct irrigation in arid fuel production areas will also be possible.

300 TW is a lot of power. Roughly 20x our current global electrical production capacity. At that scale, hydrocarbon fuels will be cheaper than they are today nearly everywhere, while electrical power will be up to 20x cheaper, strongly favoring direct electrification where possible. Cheaper fuel means less scarcity, less poverty, and less damage to the environment.

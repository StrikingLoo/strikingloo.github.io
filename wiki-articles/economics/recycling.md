### Recycling (and China)

Whenever someone throws something away and separates it on a recycle bin, it is transported to a **sorting facility**.

There metal, paper and highly dense plastics are easily separated by different industrial processes, but **low density plastic** has to then be sorted by hand.

Plastic can be in three forms:

-   **Positive Value**: It can be sold to companies for a slight (order of 10Â¢ per) profit. E.g., coca-cola bottles.
-   **Negative Value**: Plastic so useless transporting it is too expensive for it to be worth the cost. It's usually the thinnest, like plastic bags. They end up in landfills.
-   **Null-value**: can't be sold in the US, but can be transported to other places where it is actually worth something.

Since the 1990's, due to rapid industrialization, **China has needed** a lot of raw materials, including **low-value plastic**.

Therefore, it started importing it and processing it, which was **very slightly profitable** to do thanks to low-wage labor, and very high demand not met by supply (making **plastic from scratch with oil is usually cheaper than recycling** due to processing and transporting fees).

In 2017 however, China reported to the WTO that it would no longer import plastics, **reducing its imports by a factor of 99.1%**, effectively to zero. This moved the bar of profitability for recycling up, and **previously null-value plastic became negative value**, and started piling up in the landfills.

While Malaysia and a few other countries have started filling the market niche China was occupying, it seems to be only a matter of time for those countries to also realize **the externalities of recycling low-value plastic are more costly than justified** by the very tight margins of the industry.

### Industrial Revolution

A systematic **shift in technology** that **changes and improves** the way that **business** is done, while **creating new businesses across all industries** in the economy.

The **first industrial revolution** is the typical, steam-engine powered one. The **second** one comes about 1870 after a lull/plateau in production, and includes:

-   **Standardization** in processes and parts to make industrial production and machinery easier and cheaper.
-   The **Bessemer process** to make **steel** cheaper. Steel is a lot better than iron and still makes up a big chunk of infrastructure and transportation.
-   The **Telegraph**.

The **third** one is **computers** and the internet, up to and including smartphones.

The **fourth** one is supposed to be coming, according to some economists, including stuff like AI, blockchain, bioimplants, etc.

Some economists talk about first revolution parts a and b, and second with two parts as well instead of 4.

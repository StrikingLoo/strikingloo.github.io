As I said previously, this site is just a casual, fun thing I'm maintaining, mostly a repository for my thoughts and notes. That's why the Digital Garden/ Zettelkassen / Personal wiki part gets all the attention.

With that said, today I finally sat down to improve this a bit. 

Here's what I finally did today:

- Figured out how to run the site locally. My iteration speed and testing/debugging workflow improved immensely due to much shorter delay. Obviously. It was very easy, and it's now documented under 'useful bash commands'. I just hadn't really prioritized it that much, since remote testing worked anyway and the site almost never broke.
- Improved the styling a bit. There's a ton of room for improvement, I am no front-end developer or designer, but at least now the font-size isn't huge and the general style is alright.
- My favorite change: added search functionality for my Digital Garden. This will come in handy when there are a lot more notes in here. I'm thinking of doing a prettier layout than "all the filenames in a huge table", something like the beautiful garden in [Maggie Appleton's website](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)

My next things to do are:
- Keep adding notes and zettels to my Garden.
- Add a "thought trains" note where I just write whatever comes to my mind, with a very low bar for quality.
- Improve the site's design.

Anyway, this really feels like gardening in a way: it's relaxing, things grow organically and slowly as needs arise (aesthetic or otherwise).

I don't think many people will ever read this, so it's almost like a journal.

Maybe I'll start using this post as a changelog.

2022-08-16: Move all wiki-articles to wiki. Remove category pages for the time being, but they will be re-added soon.

2022-08-24: After adding the second Personal Wiki post, I removed fontawesome and replaced it with beautiful icon images. I was using very few icons and now most pages have seen a \~50% reduction in size.

2022-08-30: Make headers Georgia, blog posts have description and visible date and are inline blocks now, also lots of little changes to navigation guide and wiki main page yesterday. Also made bottom buttons lazy-loading, I wonder if someone will notice.

As I said previously, this site is just a casual, fun thing I'm maintaining, mostly a repository for my thoughts and notes. That's why the Digital Garden/ Zettelkassen / Personal wiki part gets all the attention.

With that said, today I finally sat down to improve this a bit. 

Here's what I finally did today:

- Figured out how to run the site locally. My iteration speed and testing/debugging workflow improved immensely due to much shorter delay. Obviously. It was very easy, and it's now documented under 'useful bash commands'. I just hadn't really prioritized it that much, since remote testing worked anyway and the site almost never broke.
- Improved the styling a bit. There's a ton of room for improvement, I am no front-end developer or designer, but at least now the font-size isn't huge and the general style is alright.
- My favorite change: added search functionality for my Digital Garden. This will come in handy when there are a lot more notes in here. I'm thinking of doing a prettier layout than "all the filenames in a huge table", something like the beautiful garden in [Maggie Appleton's website](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)

My next things to do are:
- Keep adding notes and zettels to my Garden.
- Add a "thought trains" note where I just write whatever comes to my mind, with a very low bar for quality.
- Improve the site's design.

Anyway, this really feels like gardening in a way: it's relaxing, things grow organically and slowly as needs arise (aesthetic or otherwise).

I don't think many people will ever read this, so it's almost like a journal.

Maybe I'll start using this post as a changelog.

2022-08-16: Move all wiki-articles to wiki. Remove category pages for the time being, but they will be re-added soon.

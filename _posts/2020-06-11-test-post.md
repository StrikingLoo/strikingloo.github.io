Honestly, this is just a fun experiment. I may use this as a very laid back blog where I rant about my life, philosophy, Politics, programming and who knows what else. This website is 90% me playing around with Jekyll, 10% content, so don't be surprised if this is the only blog post for a while.

I may also use this site as a bit of a wiki/knowledge repository for the times when Evernote doesn't seem powerful enough. I want this site to become a sort of 'digital garden' as described in [Mike Caulfield's technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/), mostly for my own use but also for anyone who may find it helpful. 

I don't plan on sharing this site on Social Media too much, however.

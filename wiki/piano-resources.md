[Andrew Furmanczyk](https://www.youtube.com/user/Lypur). Includes *'Learn How to Play Piano'* in 12 30-minute lessons (the playlist is actually expanded to 40 videos) and *'Learn Free Music Theory'* which sounds like what I am looking for, with 12 15-minute lessons. Looks like our best bet.

[Alfred's All-In-One Course Level 1 - Lets Play Piano Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8hZtgRyL9WRWJLlIUPl-ydiDc8CZ_SJK). These look fine.


[Piano Video Lessons](https://courses.pianovideolessons.com/free-online-piano-lessons/free-online-beginner-piano-lessons-year-1/). This one is free but seems very eager to sell me a bunch of ebooks, I am not sure I want to do this one. Will link to it for completion.

## Andrew Furmanczik's Course

Fingers' names go from 1 to five, from thumb to pinky.

An *inversion* of a chord is a permutation of its notes, always choosing adjacent ones. That would make a *broken chord* (I think).

### Reading sheet music

Two clefts: bass cleft and treble cleft. Bass cleft is new for me.

Mnemonics for notes:

- Treble cleft spaces: FACE
- Trecle cleft lines: Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge
- Bass cleft spaces: All Cows Eat Grass
- Bass cleft lines: Green Birds Don't Fly Away (Great Britain Differs From Albion?)

### Summary from "Concepts Piano Beginners Must Understand to Learn Fast" (Youtube)

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipcm-Ub22UY)

- Chords are everything (practice all chords and internalize them).
- Practice with 100% accuracy: pick a section of the song, practice until you can do it 5 or 7 times with no mistakes. Then move on to the next one and so on.
- Practice sight reading (reading sheets). [Related: sight reading chords](https://www.pianosightreading.com.au/sight-read-chords/).

The other two are keep a beat and keep it fun.

Another video by the same youtuber recommends a set of [7 Piano Pieces for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPybDBM57cY).

[Andrew Furmanczyk](https://www.youtube.com/user/Lypur). Includes *'Learn How to Play Piano'* in 12 30-minute lessons (the playlist is actually expanded to 40 videos) and *'Learn Free Music Theory'* which sounds like what I am looking for, with 12 15-minute lessons. Looks like our best bet.

[Alfred's All-In-One Course Level 1 - Lets Play Piano Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8hZtgRyL9WRWJLlIUPl-ydiDc8CZ_SJK). These look fine.


[Piano Video Lessons](https://courses.pianovideolessons.com/free-online-piano-lessons/free-online-beginner-piano-lessons-year-1/). This one is free but seems very eager to sell me a bunch of ebooks, I am not sure I want to do this one. Will link to it for completion.

<div class="post">
  <p>I read Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography for multiple reasons. One was that I love Hamilton and I knew Ben Franklin was the only one of the main Founding Fathers that didn’t feature in it at all, so I was wondering what he was about. Since he is also the guy on the 100 dollar bill and I knew he had done some scientific discovery or other, I was intrigued by his life. I also heard that his writings read like a productivity blog in some parts, so that sounded interesting.</p>

<p>One of his most celebrated discoveries in ‘natural philosophy’ was the <em>sameness of lightning to electricity</em>, a description I loved. As per the productivity thing, he basically had a quantified self workflow but used a paper notebook instead of a sheet (so like a bullet journal maybe).</p>

<p>He was born poor but rose to riches (mostly through a printing business). Wrote Saunder’s Almanaque which according to the book was formative for American culture, though I would love to understand how much of an impact it actually had better, and will be happy if anyone directs me to good bibliography on the topic.</p>

<p>He died at 84 after participating in the constitutional convention and being elected president of Pennsilvania twice.</p>

<p>With all that out of the way, these are the quotes from the book I liked best, either because of how they are written, or because I found their contents surprising. Ideally both.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“(I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, “Without vanity I may say,” &amp;c., but some vain thing immediately followed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This when discussing his writing an autobiography).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I balanc’d some time between principle and inclination”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Describing his uncle:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets, relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“There are many of his notes in the margins.”</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“Plutarch’s Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great advantage.” He also mentions he read “De Foe’s [book], called an Essay on Projects”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But as prose writing had been of great use to me in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what little ability I have in that way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>“I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, I had form’d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is like a 18th century blogging circle.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>“And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a subscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into form by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company was to continue.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="benjamin-vaughans-letter">Benjamin Vaughan’s Letter</h3>

<p>Franklin cites a friend’s letter where he is entreated to write his autobiography, in part as justification for this exercise in vanity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet good-humored.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Though the event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought and habit.”</p>

<p>“For the furtherance of human happiness, I have always maintained that it is necessary to prove that man is not even at present a vicious and detestable animal; and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him; and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to see the opinion established, that there are fair characters existing among the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men, without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least of making it comfortable principally for themselves. ”</p>

<p>I find it a delightful surprise that he refers, even without alluding to it by name, to a coordination problem of morality. Some of society’s problems are universal, even through the ages.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one’s self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos’d to raise one’s reputation in the smallest degree above that of one’s neighbors, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis’d it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair’d in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow’d myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business continu’d as indefatigable as it was necessary.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="quantified-self-benjamin-franklin-style">Quantified Self: Benjamin Franklin Style</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[I] Made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I rul’d each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross’d these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I determined to give a week’s strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every the least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos’d the habit of that virtue so much strengthen’d and its opposite weaken’d, that I might venture extending my attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro’ a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish’d the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should he happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks’ daily examination.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportion’d to the property. This idea, being approv’d by the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania, which was much urg’d on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to he put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat, or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment, advis’d the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but be reply’d, “I shall take the money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder,” which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>“One morning at seven o’clock, I observ’d there was not one shop open, tho’ it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I inquir’d concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was true that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us’d only in particular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself dispos’d to marry, he inform’d the elders of his class, who consulted the elder ladies that govern’d the young women. As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc’d in; but if, for example, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. <strong>“And so they may,” answer’d my informer, “if you let the parties chuse for themselves;”</strong> which, indeed, I could not deny.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for <strong>drawing lightning from the clouds.</strong> This engag’d the public attention every where. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur’d in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv’d in the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On the whole, I wonder’d much how such a man came to be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, <strong>having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What it was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such. 
The want of formality or rudeness was, probably, <strong>my not having address’d the paper to them with their assum’d titles of True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania</strong>, which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had delivered viva voce.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="turns-of-phrase-i-liked">Turns of Phrase I Liked</h3>

<p><strong>Words that are frequently used and may improve my vocabulary:</strong> induce, declare against, fall short, endeavor at, state the advantages, afford a better prospect, to my no small mortification, drawn up in strength of judgement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion”</p>

I am a foodie. I love food, I eat out pretty often, and I appreciate many kinds of food. For this reason, I decided to compile a list of my favorite restaurants from each city I've been too (highly non-exhaustive), so that when people ask me _'I'm going to Buenos Aires, where should I eat?'_ I'll have a place to point them to.

All places in this list are restaurants I've been to personally and loved. If one of them goes out of business, I will probably not find out, so do check gmaps before going. Also if you see something here is out of date, feel free to email me so I can update it.

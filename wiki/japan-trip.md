Akihabara!!

Ghibli park (Nagoya, Aichi)

kawachi wisteria garden (1h train from fukuoka approx)

Near the end of April every year Aomori Prefecture becomes pink with the blossoms of cherry trees. As one of Japan’s Top 100 Cherry Blossom Viewing Sites and one of Japan’s Top 100 Sights of People and Nature, the cherry blossoms at Hirosaki Park are famed as one of the best cherry blossom sights in Japan. Hirosaki Park is a home to 2600 trees with over 50 different types of cherry including Somei Yoshino cherry blossoms, Shidarezakura (Weeping Cherry), and Yaezakura (Double Layer Cherry). Over 2,000,000 visitors visit the park during the Hirosaki Cherry Blossom Festival, which is held annually between April 23rd and May 5th.

Kanda Matsuri (festival) is a big festival that takes place at Kanda Myojin in Ochanomizu in Tokyo. This special event is known as one of the three major festivals of Tokyo and is held over the span of a week. 

Hitachi Seaside Park in Ibaraki prefecture is famous for having 7 areas that are filled with different types of flowers almost every season. It is said that the best time of year to go to the park is in the spring from mid-April to early May when there are thousands of nemophilia flowers that blanket the park with a beautiful light blue color. (Day trip from Tokyo! 2hs by car)

Ashikaga Flower Park in Tochiji prefecture is a magical place to visit in the spring. Bringing in about 1.5 million people on an average year, it is famous for its 350 wisteria trees that turn various shades of purple and are in bloom between mid-April to mid-May. Wisteria festival too!! Suena genial, esta a ~1.30hs de Tokyo tho.

The Shibazakura festival is held in Yamanashi prefecture from April to May near the base of Mt. Fuji, with an amazing view of the famous mountain in the background. During the duration of the festival, Fujikyu operates one highway bus round trip per day between Shinjuku and the festival site. The one way trip takes three hours and costs 2450 yen. Advance reservations are required.

Go To: ikebukuro (and to a lesser extent Nakano, which is more specialist and tends not to have the latest stuff)

Mt. Yoshino is widely known as an amazing cherry blossom viewing spot that is situated in Nara Prefecture. The mountain is covered by thousands of cherry trees, creating a stunning scenery. Nara is home to world-famous historical sites like Todai-ji temple and the popular free-roaming deer that attract a lot of visitors. However, during the spring season, the city of Nara is packed with tourists who flock there to catch a glimpse of the iconic mountain range covered in beautiful cherry blossoms.

Osaka you need to hit DenDen town near Namba. Smaller version of Akihabara

You can reach Hakone quite easily from Tokyo. This small town is one of the prime places to view Mount Fuji.

Nijo Castle is 1.2 km from Hotel M's Plus Shijo Omiya, while Kyoto International Manga Museum is 1.4 km from the property. The nearest airport is Osaka Itami Airport, 37 km from Hotel M's Plus Shijo Omiya.

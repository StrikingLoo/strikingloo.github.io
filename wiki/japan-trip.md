## Almost surely

Akihabara!!

Ghibli park (Nagoya, Aichi)

Kanda Matsuri (festival) is a big festival that takes place at Kanda Myojin in Ochanomizu in Tokyo. This special event is known as one of the three major festivals of Tokyo and is held over the span of a week. 

Near the end of April every year Aomori Prefecture becomes pink with the blossoms of cherry trees. As one of Japan’s Top 100 Cherry Blossom Viewing Sites and one of Japan’s Top 100 Sights of People and Nature, the cherry blossoms at Hirosaki Park are famed as one of the best cherry blossom sights in Japan. Hirosaki Park is a home to 2600 trees with over 50 different types of cherry including Somei Yoshino cherry blossoms, Shidarezakura (Weeping Cherry), and Yaezakura (Double Layer Cherry). Over 2,000,000 visitors visit the park during the Hirosaki Cherry Blossom Festival, which is held annually between April 23rd and May 5th.

Hitachi Seaside Park in Ibaraki prefecture is famous for having 7 areas that are filled with different types of flowers almost every season. It is said that the best time of year to go to the park is in the spring from mid-April to early May when there are thousands of nemophilia flowers that blanket the park with a beautiful light blue color. (Day trip from Tokyo! 2hs by car)

Ashikaga Flower Park in Tochiji prefecture is a magical place to visit in the spring. Bringing in about 1.5 million people on an average year, it is famous for its 350 wisteria trees that turn various shades of purple and are in bloom between mid-April to mid-May. Wisteria festival too!! Suena genial, esta a ~1.30hs de Tokyo tho.

Suga Shrine ? it’s in shinjuku, easy peasy.

Nakano Broadway and Nipponbashi (otaku places?)

Tezuka Museum
Akihabara shinto shrine for otaku. 
Tokiwa-sou.? Tezuka related apparently
Pokemon area in tokyo
Tokyo Tower and Sky Tree
https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3052.html (otaku places!)

Go To: ikebukuro (and to a lesser extent Nakano, which is more specialist and tends not to have the latest stuff)

Mt. Yoshino is widely known as an amazing cherry blossom viewing spot that is situated in Nara Prefecture. The mountain is covered by thousands of cherry trees, creating a stunning scenery. Nara is home to world-famous historical sites like Todai-ji temple and the popular free-roaming deer that attract a lot of visitors. However, during the spring season, the city of Nara is packed with tourists who flock there to catch a glimpse of the iconic mountain range covered in beautiful cherry blossoms.

Osaka you need to hit DenDen town near Namba. Smaller version of Akihabara

You can reach Hakone quite easily from Tokyo. This small town is one of the prime places to view Mount Fuji.

Nijo Castle is 1.2 km from Hotel M's Plus Shijo Omiya, while Kyoto International Manga Museum is 1.4 km from the property.

**To travel from Aomori to Tokyo:**

Take a Hayabusa train on the JR Tohoku Shinkansen from Tokyo to Shin-Aomori (3.5 hours) and transfer to a local or limited express train for Aomori Station (5 minutes).

<https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Aomori/Tokyo#r/Train/s/0>
<https://www.jrbustohoku.co.jp/en/aomori.pdf>

For Lake Towada: Take the train to JR Aomori or Shin-Aomori Station. Take the JR Bus Tohoku "Mizumi-go" toward Lake Towada for about 2 hours and 45 minutes to 3 hours and 10 minutes and get off at "Towadako (Yasumiya)" (<https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3777.html?aFROM=3750_3776>)

Shichinohe-Towada Station on the Tohoku Shinkansen is the most convenient place in Aomori to get a bus going to Towada (segun gmaps, Tohoku-Hokkaido sinkansen me deja ahi en 40 minutos). Bus from there to towada = 35 mins.

JR Tohoku Bus operates direct buses between Aomori Station, Shin-Aomori Station, Mount Hakkoda and Lake Towada, stopping along Oirase Stream before terminating in Yasumiya. The one way ride takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes and costs 3,480 yen. (Vamos con este!)

Near towada lake: Suiren-numa Pond, Yachi Onsen, Oirase gorge (https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1833/)

Mount Hakkoda: A circular hiking trail leads from the upper ropeway station to a small marshland near the peak in about 45-60 minutes (round trip). https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3780.html ,

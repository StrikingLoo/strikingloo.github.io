   "Your machine is a library, not a publication device.Â You have copies of documents in there that you control directly, that you can annotate, change, add links to, summarize, and this is because the memex is a tool to think with, not a tool to publish with." -- <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">Mike Caulfield</a>

{% for item in folder1 %}
<a href="{{ item.url }}">{{item.path}}</a>

{% endfor %}

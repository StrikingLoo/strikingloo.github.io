## CABS - Board Affecting Cards or Nothing

Cards Affecting Board State (CABS) are, in order of descending importance, **creatures**, **removal**, **combat tricks**.

You should try to create a simple, well-curved, 2-color beatdown deck based on only these kinds of cards.

Life gain, combos, gimmicks, nice uncommons that require gymnastics to trigger, powerful but complex enchantments, should not be prioritized and ideally completely avoided. Just play creatures ollowing a good curve, and use removal to control the board. It is not optimal but it is leaps beyond people not following this advice (including forcing them to mulligan too much).

> You want cards that are consistently good rather than cards that are sometimes very good but sometimes very bad.

> You will avoid card-draw spells, build-around-me enchantments, counterspells, life gain spells, and the like.

15\~18 creatures.

## How to Build a Mana Base

Platonic Ideal deck: follows a curve of {2, 7, 6, 4, 3, 1} (no more than 1 card with cost >5. 7 of cost 4 or 5). 17 land, 16 creatures, 7 spells. Note that this aligns pretty well to the CABS deck described above.

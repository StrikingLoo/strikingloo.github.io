## CABS - Board Affecting Cards or Nothing

Cards Affecting Board State (CABS) are, in order of descending importance, **creatures**, **removal**, **combat tricks**.

You should try to create a simple, well-curved, 2-color beatdown deck based on only these kinds of cards.

Life gain, combos, gimmicks, nice uncommons that require gymnastics to trigger, powerful but complex enchantments, should not be prioritized and ideally completely avoided. Just play creatures ollowing a good curve, and use removal to control the board. It is not optimal but it is leaps beyond people not following this advice (including forcing them to mulligan too much).

> You want cards that are consistently good rather than cards that are sometimes very good but sometimes very bad.

> You will avoid card-draw spells, build-around-me enchantments, counterspells, life gain spells, and the like.

15\~18 creatures.

## How to Build a Mana Base

Platonic Ideal deck: follows a curve of {2, 7, 6, 4, 3, 1} (no more than 1 card with cost >5. 7 of cost 4 or 5). 17 land, 16 creatures, 7 spells. Note that this aligns pretty well to the CABS deck described above.

## BREAD Has Partly Outlived its Usefulness

> BREAD becomes less helpful once you have some experience under your belt. BREAD is vague and generally misses many ways Limited games are won. What is a Bomb card? BREAD doesn’t go into any depth or description of this. It also places a huge emphasis on Removal and Evasive creatures. While these can be great picks, they miss the fact that so many Limited games are won and lost on board presence and creatures.

Other ways to measure cards' worth are: Vanilla test (an X/X for X mana, + value for keywords), Quadrant Theory (does the card help in Opening, Parity, Winning or Losing?), [CABS theory](#cabs---board-affecting-cards-or-nothing).

For Quadrant Theory, it helps to think how a card would help in each of the phases: Opening for the early game, Parity when the initial hand is played and we're in the midgame, acting on draws, Winning for finishers that do the last mile, or Losing for disrupters if the opponent has the upper hand.

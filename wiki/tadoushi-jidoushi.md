### Type 1: ある and おる = Intransitive 
The most common by far is verbs that go from √ -(w)ar-u to　√-Ø-eru or √-Ø-u. 

Examples:

上がる→上げる　vs 塞がる→塞ぐ (intrans. → trans.).

### Type 2: S = Transitive

> These verbs all have a transitive form with a stem that ends in s. What else makes up the stem or what follows varies, but this characterizes 30% of all pairs in Japanese. Frequency, again, refers to frequency among all verb pairs. 

The most common cases are:

√-Ø-eru → √-(y)as-u ; √-Ø-u → √-(w)as-u ; √-Ø-iru → √-os-u;　√-Ø-iru　→ √-as-u

Examples:

冷える→冷やす・散る→散らす・干る→干す・生きる→生かす (intrans. → trans.)

### Type 3: Once the Same Long Ago

> Type 2 and Type 3 are extremely similar. Put together, they indicate that at one point, many transitivity verb pairs probably derived from a single verb which could function as either an intransitive or a transitive verb.

Examples:

余る→余す・現れる→現す・乗る→乗せる・越える→越す・足りる→足す

### Type 4: Change in Verb Class

> For the remaining 25% of verbs, change in verb class alone is what’s responsible for transitivity change. Nothing is added to the roots of these verbs to change transitivity. In times past, the basic verb form for these verb pairs looked identical. The only distinguishing aspect they had was having different conjugations. This indicates that these verbs may be remnants of a far older process to derive transitivity pairs. Ironically, however, this type of verb pairs is split into two polar opposite sub-types. This is where memorization becomes especially important. 

These are the most painful kind of verb pairs: you only change one into the other by adding 'e', but it can go both ways: 開く→開ける ; 割れる→割る (intrans. → trans.)

from [Karpathy's Biohacking Lite:](https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/)
"You might think that most of your energy output would come from movement, but in fact 1) your body is exceedingly efficient when it comes to movement, and 2) it is energetically unintuitively expensive to just exist."

"Glycogen, a branching polysaccharide of glucose found in your liver and skeletal muscle. The liver can store about 120 grams and the skeletal muscle about 400 grams. About 4 grams of glucose also circulates in your blood. Your body derives approximately ~4 kcal/g from full oxidation of glucose (adding up glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation), so if you do the math your glycogen battery stores about 2,000 kcal. This also happens to be roughly the base metabolic rate of an average adult, i.e. the energy just to “keep the lights on” for 24 hours."

"Collectively, this portion of energy expenditure is called the Base Metabolic Rate (BMR) and you burn this “for free” even if you slept the entire day. As an example, my BMR is somewhere around 1800kcal/day (a common estimate due to Mifflin St. Jeor for men is 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) + 5)."

"The main components of **Mediterranean diet** include:

- **Daily** consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats
- **Weekly** intake of fish, poultry, beans and eggs

The foods you eat can affect your brain health—Amen isn't the only expert on board with the idea, but he does have a few personal favorites. "I'm a huge fan of berries," he says. "Get as many different colors as you can—blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries." These deeply hued berries contain flavonoid antioxidants called anthocyanins, which likely play an important role in brain and overall health. On that note, Amen also suggests adding as many colorful veggies as you can fit onto your plate. As a general rule of thumb: The more colors you can include, the better.

"First, you’ll need your maximum heart rate which you can get by subtracting your age from 220. For example, if you’re 35, your max heart rate is 185. At this point, you can figure out what heart rate zone is best for burning fat.

At 50-60% of your maximum heart rate, you’re using 85% fat to burn calories. At 60-70% of your maximum heart rate, that drops to 65% fat being used. And at 70-80%, you’re only using 45% fat to burn calories."

About 75% of the fats in chia seeds consist of the **omega-3** alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), while about 20% consist of omega-6 fatty acids. In fact, chia seeds are the best known plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids — even better than flaxseed.

28 grams of chia seeds provides 5g of ALA omega-3 fatty acids, or 312–454% of the recommended daily intake. Therefore, you should have \~8g of chia seeds a day.

> High levels of caffeine intake may increase your risk of osteoporosis. About 400 mg a day or less probably won't cause bone loss (or other health problems), while 800 mg or more is considered the threshold for osteoporosis risk. (1 cup: \~94mg, 1L of diet coke: 128mg -regular has less-).

> You lose about 6 milligrams of calcium for every 100 milligrams of caffeine (100 grams of milk: 113mg calcium so not too troublesome, even at 30% absortion rates).

Selenium has a positive impact on your thyroid. You get a little from dairy (one cup of milk -240ml-: 5\~10 mcg). Adults 20\~50 should get 55 mcg/day. Brazil nuts provide 68\~91 mcg per nut. Going over 400 mcg can have _severe_ impact on your health.

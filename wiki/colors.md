> Design is hard. A large part of this is choosing colors.

- Use slightly blue-shifted gray instead of “perfect” gray.
- Avoid black text on non-white background. That looks dirty. Instead use tinted dark color, or white letters on dark background.
- Don’t use different hues of the same color. Colors with similar but different hues look off when combined.
- Elements that are “above” (closer) should be lighter than those that are below (on the z-axis). Especially in dark mode.
- Avoid simple linear gradients, esp. dual-color ones as background.
- Use saturated colors sparingly. Use enough whitespace and neutral content color.
- High contrast makes a design clean, as well as usable; Use dark enough text colors + whitespace; Use as few colors as possible — each additional color adds to the noise and decreases contrast.

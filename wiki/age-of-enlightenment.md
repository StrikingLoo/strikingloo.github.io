Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon and René Descartes.<br>Some of the major figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, Denis Diderot, David Hume, Immanuel Kant (e.g. [What is Enlightenment?](/wiki/what-is-enlightenment)), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Hugo Grotius, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire.

> One particularly influential Enlightenment publication was the [Encyclopédie](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/) (Encyclopedia). Published between 1751 and 1772 in 35 volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and a team of 150 other intellectuals. The Encyclopédie helped in spreading the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond.

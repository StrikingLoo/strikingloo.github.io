## GDP

GDP is the sum of **market prices** of all **finished** goods and services **produced in the country**.

Real GDP per capita is defined as GDP calculated using current prices (over time, so inflation is taken out), divided by population. It is a noisy measure of living standards. Real GDP per capita falls on recessions, which usually coincide with a peak in unemployment.

GDP can be analysed using two approaches. **The national spending approach** divides GDP into three categories: **government purchases** (government buying goods or services), **investment** (businesses buying assets that produce value) and **consumption** (consumers buying goods or services), which add up to total GDP - net exports (a last category).

**Factor income approach** divides GDP into **compensation, rent and profits**. This is equivalent to NS, but empirically measurement error will create slight mismatches. In practice we are measuring flow inward or outward.

## Wealth of Nations

There are huge GDP per capita differences between countries. These are caused by a myriad of factors.

Some factors that led to the huge growth the world's economy has had since the [industrial revolution](/wiki/industrial-revolution) are institutional (property laws, honest courts and government, rule of law), others social (appreciation for innovation, entrepreneurial spirit) and some economic (access to energy or education).

Additionally, a country's wealth correlates with its access to water, which makes trade much easier. In a map, having any water body nearby increases gdp per capita, and landlocked countries have a huge penalty to trade.

Factors of production: ideas, capital and people. These can be improved through incentives.

Institutionally, some important factors are property rights, good incentives, political stability, honest government, a dependable legal system and competitive and open markets.

## Growth and Capital Accumulation

### Solow Model

The **Solow model of economic growth** tries to address why WWII losers like Germany and Japan grew much faster than established powers like the UK and USA. The model makes a distinction between catching-up growth and cutting-edge growth.

It takes as inputs "AeLK": Innovation, human resources (education * labor) and capital, which are the **factors of production**.

**Iron Logic of Diminishing Returns**: Output grows diminishing but monotonic as a function of capital. The marginal product of capital diminishes but is never zero. E.g., output is logarithmic or square-root of capital.

**Depreciation**: Modeled as linear on the capital (**not** on the output), it dictates a _steady-state_ where it matches investment. Investment is assumed linear on the output, so depreciation always beats it in the end due to asymptotes.

Note that any percentage of capital invested will eventually converge to a steady-state, so increasing investment must eventually still lead to an end of growth. Human capital behaves similarly (here, depreciation is a little more tragic).

Production explains part of the difference in growth and convergence between countries, but institutions as discussed previously explain a different portion of the phenomenon. However, between countries with similar institutions, like OECD western founding members, it is true that wealth correlates inversely with growth.

### Economics of Ideas

**Ideas** are taken as the explanation for growth in the cutting edge. Countries that are in the steady state of capital and labor still grow. Why? Because of innovation. 

In the Solow model (at least as covered in MRU) they have a multiplicative impact in production, so that Y = A * sqrt(K). They also shift convergence to a higher investment steady-state, so that production again increases. If ideas increase over time, then both investment and production will keep growing at a steady pace.

The production of ideas can be incentivized through institutions, and the course makes an emphasis in investment firms and incubators (like ycombinator), and patenting systems as drivers of innovation.

**Ideas want to spread**: Unlike physical goods, ideas are nonrivalrous. Once N people know something, making the next one learn it doesn't reduce the value for the first N. However there needs to be a way to incentivize inventors, or new ideas would not be produced.

Patents are enshrined in the constitution: it stipulates that a limited-time license for the use of inventions is created so as to incentivize and protect inventors.

Ideas can also be incentivized (publicly or privately) by funding inputs or outputs: either funding research with big downstream impact (especially basic research) or assigning rewards for finding solutions to unsolved problems (e.g., reward for inventing a [carbon capture technology](/wiki/solar-energy) that is at least XYZ efficient).

The course mentions ideas as a function of population, incentives and average individual "creativity", multiplicatively.

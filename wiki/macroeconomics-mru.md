## GDP

GDP is the sum of **market prices** of all **finished** goods and services **produced in the country**.

Real GDP per capita is defined as GDP calculated using current prices (over time, so inflation is taken out), divided by population. It is a noisy measure of living standards. Real GDP per capita falls on recessions, which usually coincide with a peak in unemployment.

GDP can be analysed using two approaches. **The national spending approach** divides GDP into three categories: **government purchases** (government buying goods or services), **investment** (businesses buying assets that produce value) and **consumption** (consumers buying goods or services), which add up to total GDP - net exports (a last category).

**Factor income approach** divides GDP into **compensation, rent and profits**. This is equivalent to NS, but empirically measurement error will create slight mismatches. In practice we are measuring flow inward or outward.

## Wealth of Nations

There are huge GDP per capita differences between countries. These are caused by a myriad of factors.

Some factors that led to the huge growth the world's economy has had since the industrial revolution are institutional (property laws, honest courts and government, rule of law), others social (appreciation for innovation, entrepreneurial spirit) and some economic (access to energy or education).

Additionally, a country's wealth correlates with its access to water, which makes trade much easier. In a map, having any water body nearby increases gdp per capita, and landlocked countries have a huge penalty to trade.

Factors of production: ideas, capital and people. These can be improved through incentives.

Institutionally, some important factors are property rights, good incentives, political stability, honest government, a dependable legal system and competitive and open markets.

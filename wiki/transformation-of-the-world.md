description: "Excerpts from the book the Transformation of the World, by Jürgen Osterhammel, about 19th century History."
abstract: "The book <i>'The Transformation of the World'</i>, by Jürgen Osterhammel, is a wide survey of the history of the 19th century. Covering the period roughly starting with the French Revolution and ending with WWI, it focuses in describing the political, economic and social history of several societies through the lense of a different aspect on each chapter. It deals especially with Europe, the United States and Asia, while also covering in less depth matters pertaining to Africa, the British Dominions and even Latin America. What follows is mostly my excerpts from the book, which being so long practically forced me to highlight a large collection of text. Most of the quotes are standalone facts or descriptions that I found fascinating for one reason or another."

### Chapter 1: Visibility and Audibility

> “The Birth of the Modern World, a work published in English in 2004 and in German two years later, which has rightly been praised as one of the few successful syntheses of world history in the late modern period.”

> “If these themes had been developed in a “panoramic” scope, the requisite scale of the book would have made excessive demands on the reader’s patience as much as on the author’s stamina.”

“The theater inaugurated in 1911 in Hanoi, the capital of French Indochina, was especially massive, dwarfing many in the mother country with its 750 seats for the fewer than three thousand French in the city.”

### Chapter 2: Treasuries of Memory and Knowledge

> “In China, the state had from early on monopolized the collection of handwritten material.<br>There were few archives of nonstate institutions such as temples, monasteries, guilds, or clans. It was customary for a dynasty to destroy the records of its predecessor once the official history of it was complete. ”

> “In 1800 the young American republic staked its claim with the founding of the Library of Congress, and by the early 1930s its vast holdings, the largest anywhere in the world, completed the cultural emancipation of the New World from the Old. ”

> “Many of the trophies that Napoleon had carried off to Paris were jubilantly repatriated after 1815—the Louvre lost roughly four-fifths of its holdings—”

> “In Norway and Finland, national collections predated independent statehood and contributed to the visibility of nationalist movements. In Britain, there was no national history museum; the British Museum was meant to encompass “civilization” in the widest possible sense. However, Parliament established the National Portrait Gallery in 1856, with the aim of strengthening national and imperial sentiment.”

> “Great encyclopedias, as monumental shrines to what is known and worth knowing, are akin to archives, museums, and even world exhibitions; they are also memory hoards and cathedrals of knowledge. ”

> “Even though for years Larousse provided a small extra income to large sections of the indigent Parisian intelligentsia, he wrote many of the 24,146 pages in his own hand. He was a radical republican, a supporter of the Great Revolution, and an opponent of the Second Empire, but the authorities left him alone and no censor ventured to read the mammoth work. Larousse’s aim was not to educate the bourgeoisie but to prepare “the people” for democracy; the volumes were printed on cheap paper and scantily illustrated to make them more affordable. No issue was too hot for him to handle”

> “The nineteenth century was an age of well-nurtured memory. This is one of the reasons why it retains a strong presence in today’s world. The collecting and exhibiting institutions that it created continue to prosper, without being tied to the goals set at the time when they were founded.”

### Chapter 3: Observation, Description, Realism

> “London Labour and the London Poor (1861–62). It “stood alone,” the author proudly claimed, “as a photograph of life as actually spent by the lower classes of the Metropolis,” a good part of it “from their own lips.”

> “Sara Jeanette Duncan took up the formation of a Canadian national consciousness in The Imperialist (1904).”

> “Abdülaziz was the first Turkish head of state to visit Christian Europe, on the occasion of the Paris World Exhibition in 1867”

### Chapter 4: Numbers

> “In the 1830s and 1840s, several European countries were gripped by a passion for statistics. It made things visible that had previously been hidden or taken for granted. The poor appeared as a social entity only when they were counted, and the resulting emergence of “poverty” as an abstract concept helped to arouse a moral commitment. Statistical societies and journals were founded, and government offices were called into being to gather, evaluate, and store social data. Politics rested more than ever before on exact information. In France, the systematic and regular collection of data was instituted at the prefecture level in 1801. Seeking to make deep inroads into civil society, the Napoleonic state needed as much accurate information as possible about it. In Britain too, despite its much less developed regional bureaucracy, the parliamentary government made extensive use of empirical facts about all manner of things—from sanitation in workers’ districts to the medical condition of soldiers in the army.”

### Chapter 5: News

> “It is also possible to see the space opened up by the press in a different light, as a new level of society’s reflection of itself. The distinctions between different types of printed media were fluid. In the early decades of the century, short “pamphlets” played an important role and evaded censorship more successfully than books or newspapers. The hazy boundaries were apparent in the fact that many novels, including most of those by Dickens, originally appeared in serial form in magazines.”

> “The Karlsbad Decrees of 1819 established highly repressive press laws in the German Confederation, and although the censors often found it too difficult to apply them rigorously, they were a daily nuisance for publishers and journalists. But the Karlsbad system did not survive the revolution of 1848; pre-publication censorship was anyway no longer necessary, since the state apparatuses had other means to control the printed word. Police and the courts took over the job of the censor, whose passing began to be almost regretted. The first German state to introduce full freedom of the press was the Kingdom of Württemberg, in 1864, but it was another ten years before an imperial press law ended preventive censorship for good throughout the Reich. From then on, publications that offended the authorities had to fear harassment but no longer suppression. In his later battle against Catholics and especially Social Democrats, however, Otto von Bismarck did not refrain from attacking press freedom.”

> “Until the turn of 1881, a deeply divided France had witnessed a struggle over press freedom more severe than in any other country in Europe.”

> “The viceroys valued the press both as a means of communicating with the population and as a source that relayed information and attitudes from Indian society. Together with the English legal tradition that generally tied the hands of the state, these pragmatic considerations explain nineteenth-century India’s significance as a country with a highly developed press system. The same cannot be said of the colonies of other European powers. Although the Netherlands was at least as democratic a country as Britain, it was much more fearful of liberalizing press controls and public life in general in the East Indies than the British Raj was in India.”

> “When Russell began his career he still had to send his reports to London by mail, but the cabling of the world by telegraph changed the conditions for long-distance reporting within the space of twenty-five years. The electrical overland telegraph came into use in 1844. The first durable underwater cable was laid across the English Channel in 1851, and a permanent transatlantic link was established in 1866. <br>By 1862 the worldwide terrestrial telegraph network was 150,000 miles in length; by 1876 India and all the settler colonies of the British Empire were linked to the home country and one another; and by 1885 Europe could be reached from nearly all large cities by underwater cable.”

> “It was much more centralized than today’s Internet. The telegraph lines themselves, as well as the financial threads of a global cable business that served the needs of commerce more than those of the press, converged in London.”

> “The Crimean War (1853–56) was the last major international event that was not mainly reported on by cable. By 1861, Reuter’s firm—still the only news agency with a global reach—had built a network of correspondents that covered the whole of Europe as well as India, China, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Where the telegraph did not reach, it used the express mail service provided by steamships. ”

## Part II: Time

> “Not infrequently it is a major historical work that first calls an epoch into being: whether it be “Hellenism” (Droysen), the “Renaissance” (Michelet, Burckhardt), the “late Middle Ages” (Huizinga) or “late antiquity” (Peter Brown).”

> “Eric Hobsbawm, the author of one of the best general histories of Europe since the French Revolution, does not give the nineteenth century (which for him is “long”) a single overarching name but divides it into three: the Age of Revolution (1789–1848), the Age of Capital (1848–75) and the Age of Empire (1875–1914).”

### Chapter 4: The Age of Revolution, Victorianism, Fin de Siécle

> “First, as C. A. Bayly in particular has shown, the global relationship of forces changed dramatically during this period. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were an age in which the most successful large organizations of European origin (Spain’s colonial empire and the intercontinental trading networks of the Dutch and English chartered companies) were unable to gain clear superiority over China and the “gunpowder empires” of the Islamic world ”

> “Only the advent of the fiscal-military state in England and elsewhere, organized for conquest on the basis of rational resource use, gave Europe a significantly greater punch in the world. ”

> “All three empires expanded with such force and on such a scale that the period between 1760–70 and 1830 may be described as a “first age of global imperialism.”

> “The great conflict of empires between 1793 and 1815 ranged even farther beyond Europe. Fought on four continents, it was a genuine world war that had a direct impact as far away as Southeast Asia, and in 1793 even affected China, when Lord Macartney traveled to Beijing to put out the first diplomatic feelers to the imperial court.”

> “a weakening of the Asiatic empires, partly for reasons specific to each one, which for the first time caused them to fall behind Europe in military capability”

> “The interplay of these forces changed the political geography of the world. Spain, Portugal, and France disappeared from the American landmass. The expansion of the Asiatic empires finally ground to a halt. Britain built a position of supremacy in India as a springboard for further assaults, established itself securely in Australia, and covered the globe with a network of naval bases.”

> “Second, the provisional political emancipation of settler societies in the Western hemisphere around 1830 (with the major exception of Canada, which remained in the British Empire), together with the colonization of Australia around the same time, led to a general strengthening of the “white” position in the world.”

> “Third, one of the major novelties of the Sattelzeit was the emergence of inclusive forms of social solidarity and a new ideal of civil equality. This “nationalism”

> “Fourth. It was only in the United States that the ideal of civil equality translated into broad popular involvement in political decision making—albeit with the exclusion of women, Indians, and black slaves—and a system of checks on the country’s rulers.”

> “Fifth. Periodization is more difficult in social history than in political history. The transition from a society dominated by estates to a class society is clearly discernible in countries such as France, the Netherlands, Prussia, and, a few decades later, Japan. But it is not easy to find estates in eighteenth-century Britain, and they existed only at a rudimentary level in the United States and the British dominions, and a fortiori in India, Africa, and China.”

> “Fully fledged “bourgeois societies” remained in a minority throughout the nineteenth century. A growing tendency toward class formation was a direct consequence or accompaniment of the gradual spread of industrial capitalism around the world, which did not begin until 1830 and reached the most advanced country in Asia—Japan—only after 1870.”

> “even in England, early industrialization led to a noteworthy economic upturn only after 1820.”

> “the “fossil fuel age” began around 1820; it was then that the use of stored fossil energy (coal) in place of wood, peat, and human or animal muscle power became a visible option in production processes throughout the economy.”

> “the incandescent lamp (1876), the Maxim gun (1884), the automobile (1885–86), cinematography (1895), wireless transmission (1895), and radiological diagnosis (1895). The most significant for economic history was the technological-industrial application of discoveries in the fields of electricity (dynamo, electric motor, power-plant technology) and chemistry, in both of which the 1880s were the decisive years. The serial production of electric motors alone revolutionized whole branches of industry and commerce that had been little served by the steam engine.”

### Chapter 5: Clocks and Acceleration

> “The logic of train timetables had cried out for coordination, but the actual work of reform had dragged on and on. As late as 1874, railroad time in Germany was calculated on the basis of local times in big cities, each of which had to be precisely measured and officially monitored. Passengers had to calculate for themselves the hour at which they would reach their destination. In 1870 the United States had more than four hundred railroad companies and seventy-five different “railroad times”; each passenger had to report to the counter in accordance with the time in use for his or her journey. A first step toward standardization was the electrical synchronization of clocks for the reckoning of time within a single railroad company.”

> “democratization of the pocket watch,” as David Landes described it, put punctuality within the reach of all. Annual world output of pocket watches climbed from 350,000–400,000 units at the end of the eighteenth century to more than 2.5 million in 1875, at which point the manufacturing of cheap timepieces had been extant for only a few years. The main producer countries were then Switzerland, France, Britain, and the United States. It is not known how many watches found their way into non-Western pockets.”

> “Lewis Mumford’s observation that the clock, not the steam engine, was the most important mechanism of the industrial age is applicable at least for the non-Western world. The clock was incomparably more widespread than the steam engine. It ordered and disciplined societies in a way in which production technology alone could not have done. There were clocks in parts of the world where people had never seen a coal-fired machine or locomotive.”

> “Workers who moved from agriculture or handicrafts into the early factories found themselves subject to a strange new concept of abstract time represented by clocks, bells, and penalties”

> “Japanese peasants of the late Togukawa period (up to 1867), who competed with one another in small economic units overwhelmingly geared to intensive agriculture and craft production for the market, did not by any means live in idyllic harmony with the rhythms of nature but related to time as a precious resource to be used in accordance with a well-thought-out plan. A bad economy of time would spell ruin for the family. When industrialization began around 1880, laborers were already occupied continuously in a flow of work through all seasons of the year. The new discipline of the factory—which in Japan was actually quite lax for a long time—did not feel too oppressive. Unlike their working-class comrades in Europe or the United States, Japanese laborers complained little about the intensity of exploitation and did not make a shorter workday one of their central demands. More important to them was the moral issue that management should recognize them as partners within the enterprise hierarchy.”

> “Thus in 1830, European knowledge of China’s inland provinces still relied on reports by Jesuits from the seventeenth or eighteenth century; and as for Japan, still tightly sealed from foreigners, not much advance had been made on the classical report of a trip made in the 1690s by the Westphalian doctor Engelbert Kaempfer. In all these cases a fresh pair of eyes were necessary.”

### Metageography: Naming Spaces

> “Thus in 1830, European knowledge of China’s inland provinces still relied on reports by Jesuits from the seventeenth or eighteenth century; and as for Japan, still tightly sealed from foreigners, not much advance had been made on the classical report of a trip made in the 1690s by the Westphalian doctor Engelbert Kaempfer. In all these cases a fresh pair of eyes were necessary.”

> “At the time, Napoleon III was seeking to build a French empire in the region—an ambition that came to a shabby end in 1867 with the expulsion of French troops from Mexico and the execution of Maximilian, the Frenchbacked Habsburg emperor of the country. The strategic attraction of the “Latin” tag was that it promised to construct “natural” bonds between the Romance-speaking peoples of France and the Americas.”

### Mental Maps: the Relativity of Spacial Perspective

> “From the time of Peter the Great until the Congress of Vienna, Western Europe had thought of the Tsarist Empire as increasingly “civilized.” But after the suppression in 1825 of the moderately constitutionalist Decembrist movement, followed five years later by the defeat of the Polish November Uprising and the beginning of the “Great Emigration” of persecuted popular heroes, Russia became the great bogey of West European liberalism.”

> “Even more than compact nation-states, empires strung out across the world required their possessions to be made visually present. Indeed, there is much to be said for the view that only the publication of world maps, with their famous imperial red from the 1830s on, generated a sense of empire in the British public.”

> “The historian Daniel K. Richter once tried to imagine how the original inhabitants of North America came to know of the arrival of Europeans on the East Coast: first a series of dramatic (perhaps contradictory) rumors would have spread with great effect; then strange objects might have begun to appear in villages by various convoluted routes; and finally, at a later stage, the Indians would have came face to face with white men. In this way a completely new native American cosmology was built up over time. Many peoples around the world have had similar experiences.”

> “In 1871 forty-nine Japanese dignitaries and senior officials, comprising half of the ruling oligarchy, set off on a journey of discovery to the United States and Europe that was planned to last one and a half years. Some things were already known from books, and from nearly two centuries of diplomatic contacts. But much else surprised those who took part in this “Iwakura mission” (named after its leader): not only the strange lifestyle habits of foreigners but also Japan’s backwardness in many fields, the differences between Europe and America, the decline of the level of civilization within Europe as one moved farther east from Paris and London, and above all the fact that Europe’s spectacular successes had been achieved only within the past few decades.”

> “the first map of Paris that accurately reflected the lay of its buildings dated only from the beginning of the 1780s, not as a service to tourists but as a tool for the resolution of property issues.”

> “The old notion that Europe’s East India trading companies dominated trade in the Indian Ocean before the nineteenth century may have become untenable, but rigorous quantitative research has also corrected the opposite view that early modern European trade in Asia dealt only in unimportant luxury goods.”

> “In the nineteenth century, British rule was the cardinal political fact in South Asia. India was the center of an extensive political-military and economic field of force. It served as the military base for control of the entire Orient; Indian troops (sepoys) were deployed in Egypt as early as 1801.”

> “One peculiarity of the Indian Ocean, in comparison with other oceans, was the absence of neo-European settler colonies—if we leave aside South Africa, which, though a staging post on the route to and from Europe, did not have a strong maritime orientation in its economic structure. Thus, despite the unbroken European presence and control on the coasts and major islands, the Indian Ocean remained Afro-Asian demographically. ”

### Spaces of Interaction: Land and Sea

> “ In December 1823, US President James Monroe declared the eponymous doctrine that, though born out of specific problems in foreign policy, signaled a turning away from the Atlantic and a reorientation westward toward the interior of the continent. Subsequent trends down to the 1890s give the impression that, after a falling out that climaxed in the 1860s with the US Civil War and the French intervention in Mexico, Europeans and Americans drew closer again but with much hesitation.”

Excerpt From
The Transformation of the World
Camiller, Patrick, Osterhammel, Jrgen

> “From Johann Gottfried Herder and his followers in the early nineteenth century comes the Romantic triad that is applied to the history of nations: ”

> “From Johann Gottfried Herder and his followers in the early nineteenth century comes the Romantic triad that is applied to the history of nations:  Latin—Germanic—Slav.”

> “ In 1864 Sweden did not practice Scandinavian solidarity in relation to the German-Danish war. And Norway, which the Swedes had taken from the Danes in 1814, strove for statehood that it finally achieved in 1905. ”

> “In the case of China, one is struck by a stability of spatial schemas that has no match elsewhere in the world. The division of the empire into provinces goes back to the thirteenth century. The basic template of spatial organization created at that time is still visible today. Since China is equal to Western Europe in size, it would be as if the territorial structure of Europe had not changed appreciably since the Middle Ages. China’s provinces are not organically evolved “landscapes” in the sense of European constitutional history; they are administrative constructs.”

> “In line with this revaluation of viable territories, there was a dramatic reduction in the world total of independent political entities—in Europe from five hundred in 1500 to twenty-five in 1900. <br>The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803 (a law of the Imperial Diet that secularized a large number of clerical territories and licensed medium-sized states in Germany to swallow up their smaller neighbors), the founding of the German Reich in 1871, the abolition of the traditional system of princely domains in Japan in 1871, and the colonial conquest of India and Africa involved the elimination of hundreds of semi-autonomous rulerships.”

> “Outside Europe this was not only a consequence of European expansion. In mainland Southeast Asia, for example, the precolonial eighteenth century had already witnessed a fall in the number of independent entities from twenty-two to three: Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam.”



### Territoriality, Diaspora and Borders

> “It was at once a by-product and marker of the territorialization of power as control over land became more important than control over people. Sovereign authority was no longer invested in a personal ruler but in “the state.” Its territories had to be contiguous and rounded off: scattered holdings, enclaves, city-states (Geneva became a canton of Switzerland in 1813), or political “patchwork quilts” were now seen as anachronisms.”

### Penal Colony and Exile

> “At the beginning of the twentieth century, French Guyana had a system of prisons and forced labor that encompassed roughly a fifth of its total population (not including indigenous tribes and gold prospectors). Banishment to the “pepper islands” was abolished only in 1936.”

> “759 convicts sailed into Botany Bay (close to today’s Sydney) on January 18, 1788. The loss of the North American colonies had put the British state in the position of having to find somewhere else to send convicts. After a number of extreme alternatives—such as an island in the Gambia River in West Africa—were rejected on humanitarian grounds, someone remembered Captain Cook’s discovery of Botany Bay in 1770. Although other motives, such as the maritime rivalry with France, should not be excluded, this spectacular solution would probably not have been adopted had it not been for the acute convict crisis of the mid-1780s. In any event, Australia was little more than a huge penal colony during the early decades of its colonial history. The first settlers were forced immigrants, dispatched by an English judge to faraway Oceania.
By the time of the last convict ship in 1868, 162,000 people had been transported as prisoners to Australia. ”

> “In January 1898, official statistics revealed the presence of 298,600 deportees in Siberia, and if family members are included the total must have been around 400,000, or nearly 7 percent of the total population of Siberia.”

> “Never before the nineteenth century had so much politics been conducted from exile. Prince Adam Czartoryski in Paris, the “uncrowned king of Poland” whom people also called the “one-man Great Power,” organized Europe-wide agitation against Tsar Nicholas I and tried to swear his divided compatriots to a common strategy and objectives. Alexander Herzen, Giuseppe Mazzini, and the oft-exiled firebrand Giuseppe Garibaldi also operated from abroad. The Greek revolt against Ottoman rule was planned by exiles. At the same time, the Ottoman Empire was not simply a bastion of despotism but could itself become a place of refuge for defeated freedom fighters. In 1849, after a Tsarist interventionist force helped to crush the Hungarian independence movement, Lajos Kossuth and thousands of his supporters found sanctuary in the sultan’s realms. British and French diplomats strengthened the resolve of the Sublime Porte to reject Russian extradition requests by referring to customary practice in the “civilized world” (in which, exceptionally, they were prepared to include Istanbul).”

### Mobilities

> “Between 1800 and 1850, the number of people living on planet Earth rose by a yearly average of 0.43 percent. In the second half of the century, the rate of increase accelerated to 0.51 percent—which is still little in comparison with the 1.94 percent growth rate reached in the 1970s.”

### The Legacy of Early Modern Migrations: Creoles and Slaves

> “The Netherlands also pursued a strategy of sending foreigners into the unhealthiest parts of the tropics. Generally in colonial history we often find “third” population groups in addition to the colonized and the members of the colonizing nation. At the end of the nineteenth century, for example, more Spanish than French lived in certain départements of Algeria.”

> “The transatlantic slave trade bridged the early modern period and the nineteenth century. It reached a peak during the decades around 1800, ensuring that the institution of slavery would survive the abolition of the trade by several decades. The formation of immigrant societies in the Western hemisphere entered a new phase in the second half of the nineteenth century, when forced migration across the Atlantic played a much lesser role than before.”

### Ethnic Cleansing

> “The Tatars who in the eighteenth century left their homes in the Crimean peninsula to settle inside the Ottoman Empire did so because of Russian contempt for their way of life, loss of land to Russian settlers, and the growth of Russian anti-Islamism. The emigration began during the Russian-Ottoman war of 1768–74 and intensified after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate in 1783. At least 100,000 Crimean Tatars, including nearly the entire upper stratum (the notables), moved to Anatolia over the following decade and became the core of what Tatars themselves call the “first exile” (sürgün). The Crimean War (1853–56) then sealed the fate of those still in the peninsula, whom the Russians regarded as a fifth column of the hated Ottomans. By the end of the conflict 20,000 Crimean Tatars had been given asylum and evacuated on board Allied ships, while the same number again had fled by other routes. In the early 1860s another 200,000 Tatars are said to have left the Crimea under wretched conditions.”

### Internal Migration and the Changing Slave Trade

> “Free peasants, runaway serfs, landowners, criminals, and even, between 1762 and the 1830s, people deliberately recruited from Germany were the pioneers in this large-scale process of farm settlement. From 1801 to 1850, a yearly average of no more than 7,500 (including exiles and prisoners) moved to Siberia, but then the yearly figure rose to between 19,000 and 42,000 in the period from 1851 to 1890. The total number of immigrants to Siberia for the years from 1851 to 1914 is estimated at six million.”

> “The huge ox herds that once traveled across Hungary and as far as central Germany and Alsace became unnecessary as animal farming improved, slaughtering became industrialized, the railroad network expanded, and freezing technology developed in the 1880s.<br>Nowhere else in the world was there anything like the herds of 150,000 to 400,000, occasionally as high as 600,000, that a couple of thousand cowboys used to drive north from Texas for three months at a time between the 1860s and 1880s.”


> “In the Ottoman Empire, the sultanic center always had to negotiate with powerful tribes, and migrant labor played a significant role in numerous sectors of the economy. After the onset of reform in the late 1830s a newly assertive state broke the power of the tribes or drove them into marginal regions of the empire, thereby enhancing its internal security and improving mobility for nonnomads.”

> “An especially thorough examination of the evidence has arrived at a figure of 12.5 million for the slaves who embarked from Africa; the horrors of the transatlantic “middle passage” meant that the number of arrivals was 10 to 20 percent lower (compared with a maximum loss of approximately 5 percent on ships carrying European emigrants). The best estimate of the slaves who arrived between 1501 and 1867 at the major ports in the Atlantic world puts the number at 10,705,805”

> “If we accept an estimate of 11.5 million for the total number of African slaves who crossed the Sahara, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, then it would be on the same scale as the transatlantic trade throughout its history—not including the slaves who ended up in Egypt.”

### Migration and Capitalism

> “Net immigration into the United States for the whole period from its founding until 1821 has been estimated at 366,000,148 more than half of whom (54 percent) came from Ireland, and just under a quarter from England, Scotland, and Wales.”

> “The number of new immigrants in the United States grew from 14,000 a year in the 1820s to 260,000 in the 1850s and a peak of approximately a million in 1911.”

> “Unforced migration across the Atlantic can also be estimated only approximately. Informed conjectures hover around 55 million for the whole period between 1820 and 1920,152 60 percent of it (33 million) to the United States. The second most important destination was Argentina, to which roughly 5.5 million (10 percent) emigrated between 1857 and 1924, followed by Canada and Brazil”

> “Argentina is an extreme case in the history of emigration. Nowhere else in the world, including the United States, did immigrants constitute such a high proportion of the population by the end of the nineteenth century. In 1914, of the eight million people living in a country five times larger than France, approximately 58 percent had either been born abroad or were children of first-generation immigrants. For decades, one-half of the inhabitants of the capital, Buenos Aires, had not been born in Argentina. ”

> “then an agricultural revolution that, within a few years after 1875, turned the former grain importer into one of the world’s largest exporters of wheat.”

> “In 1882 the Buddhist master Xuyun set off on a journey to Wutaishan, a holy mountain in the Chinese province of Shandong. Since he prostrated himself fully after every three paces, he needed two years to cover the roughly fifteen hundred kilometers.”

> “The Australian case confirms the economic rule that governments of democratic states prefer an immigration policy that can be expected to maintain or increase the income of their electorate.”

## Living Standards

> “Standard of living” is a touch more palpable than “quality of life.” But it involves a tension between the “hard” economic magnitude of income and the “soft” criterion of the utility that an individual or group derives from its income. Recently it has been suggested that “standard of living” should be defined in terms of the capacity to master short sharp crises, such as a sudden drop in income due to unemployment, higher prices, or the death of a family breadwinner. Those who manage to pull through such crises and to plan their lives long into the future may be said to have a high standard of living. More specifically, under premodern conditions this was mainly a question of the strategies that individuals and groups applied to avoid an early death, and of their degree of success in doing so.”

> “In 1800 the average life expectancy at birth for the world population was at most thirty years; only exceptionally did it rise to thirty-five or a little higher. More than a half of all people died before reaching adulthood. Few enjoyed a life after work: either at the end of the day or in retirement following years of occupational activity. Death typically came as a result of infections: it came more swiftly than it does today, when protracted degenerative disease is the main cause of death in the rich countries.”

> “Why the human life span “exploded” in the nineteenth century is a controversial question: the decisive factor is variously considered to have been advances in medicine and sanitation, better nourishment, or new public health measures.”

> “the quantity and above all the quality of food did not keep pace with the physical demands of early-industrial factory labor, so that, according to Robert Fogel, the growth of real incomes registered in the statistics must be reduced by as much as 40 percent before it can be converted into physical well-being. In the early nineteenth century, the United States was alone among “Western” societies in guaranteeing its citizens more than the minimum degree of nourishment.”

> “In 1842, in one of the city’s grandest festivals, New York celebrated the inauguration of a system of aqueducts, pipes, and reservoirs that supplied public wells, private households, and the fire brigade. The value of clean water became especially apparent after an English doctor, John Snow, established in 1849 that cholera was not transmitted in the air or by bodily contact but was a water-borne disease. It took more than fifty years, however, for his findings to become generally accepted.”

> “The technology used for this monument of modernity was curiously preindustrial, if one leaves aside the magnificent Florentine or Moorish pumping stations equipped with steam engines. Brick-lined sewers and glazed ceramic pipes were nothing new; the movement of the water was simply down to their angle of incline. Technically speaking, the Victorian drainage system could have been built at any time in the previous hundred years. It was all a question of perception, political will, and a new attitude to dirt.”

> “The owners of the water plant tried to increase its operational radius and by no means wished to deprive the Chinese of clean water out of “colonial” motives. But the Chinese population remained skeptical: they had survived for generations, more or less, on water from the Huangpu River. Also the guilds representing more than three thousand water carriers protested against the new competition”

> “Improved sanitation probably played a greater role in reducing mortality in Europe and North America than elsewhere in the world, where attempts are still being made to achieve comparable results with simpler and cheaper technology. The universality of ends was not matched by a universalization of means. The influence of the West, then, was differentiated.”

### Medical Fears and Prevention

> “From the late 1850s onward, Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch discovered that certain diseases were caused by microbes, and in a number of cases they developed medical therapies. The first post-Jenner vaccine, however, appeared only in 1881, when Pasteur isolated the anthrax bacillus; then Koch found an antitoxin against diphtheria in 1890. Around 1900 medical science had only a few reliable drugs at its disposal—among them quinine, digitalis, and opium. Aspirin appeared on the market in July 1899.”

> “But one of the major achievements of the nineteenth century was a new insight into the underlying causes of inflammatory processes. From about 1880, the general use of antisepsis and disinfection reduced the incidence of mortality in childbirth, but only in Western countries.”

> “An additional factor was the transition everywhere in eighteenth-century European cities from wooden and half-timbered construction to stone architecture, which meant that rats, the main carrier of plague, lost some of their habitat.”

> “Within the space of twenty years—between 1824 and 1845—it rapidly disappeared from the Ottoman Empire, with the exception of endemic areas in Kurdistan and Iraq. Tighter quarantines and new official health authorities played a key role in this, but the end of the plague in the Ottoman Empire, a turning point in the history of the disease, has not yet been fully explained. There remains an element of mystery.”

> “It was Yersin who in 1894 discovered both the plague pathogen and the essential role played by rats; soon afterward the flea was identified as the carrier.”

> “Nowhere was the plague more devastating than in India,88 where it appeared with epidemic force in 1896, first of all in Bombay. Of the 13.2 million deaths from the disease recorded worldwide between 1894 and 1934, 12.5 million were in India. Hunger and plague were mutually reinforcing. The British authorities acted at least as harshly as they had in 1894 in Hong Kong, and more so than in previous epidemics of smallpox and cholera. Victims were locked up in camps or forced into special hospices, where the mortality rate was as high as 90 percent. Houses were searched for the dead and infected, travelers were subjected to physical examination, roofs and walls were removed to let in air and light, and huge quantities of disinfectant were sprayed around. This heavy-handed approach was a result of international pressure to halt the spread of the disease and of a determination to prevent the complete breakdown of life in the big cities, but it also reflected the scientific self-confidence and image building of the medical profession. In any event, it proved as ineffectual in India as in Hong Kong. People ran away to escape the draconian measures and took the pathogen with them.”

> “\[Cholera] appeared suddenly and could theoretically strike anyone, leading with plague-like probability (more than 50 percent of cases) to death in a time that might be as short as a few hours. Unlike smallpox, which causes a high fever, cholera is always described as a “cold” illness; unlike tuberculosis or “consumption,” it is ill suited to any romanticism. Patients neither become delirious nor slip into a coma; they remain fully aware of what is happening to them. Diarrhea, vomiting, a bluing of the face and limbs: the symptoms resemble those of acute arsenic poisoning. Cholera, says the medical historian Christopher Hamlin, “was not a disease that a person lived with.”

> “Finally, there was epidemic typhus, sometimes known as jail fever, quite devoid of glamour, or even of the frisson caused by the “democratic” horseman of the apocalypse who levels the highest and the lowest in society. It was a disease of poverty in a cold climate, the complete opposite of a tropical disease. Carried by lice, it tended to appear where poor sanitary conditions and fuel poverty meant that people living closely together did not change and wash their clothes often enough. Typhus, together with typhoid fever and dysentery, is a classic disease of war. Until the First World War it accompanied every modern conflict in Europe. The decimation of Napoleon’s Grande Armée resulted more from dysentery and typhus than from the operations of all its other adversaries.”

> “In many respects, the medical history of the nineteenth century belongs to the ancien régime. There were still distinctive risk groups, the chief one being soldiers of every nation. The wars to conquer New Zealand were possibly the only ones in the century in which more European soldiers died in battle or from accidents than as a result of disease. The opposite extreme was the campaign in Madagascar in 1895, when some 6,000 French soldiers died of malaria and only 20 in military action. A new era dawned outside Europe with the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–5, when the Japanese, thanks to meticulous vaccination and medical facilities, managed to keep their losses through disease to a quarter of the numbers killed in battle.”

> “The first aspect covers the global retreat of smallpox in the face of Jennerinspired vaccination and the prevention and treatment of malaria with alkaloids obtained and developed from cinchona bark.”

> “The second aspect was the rise of laboratory medicine, associated with the names of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, which was one of the great innovations of the age. After its first major successes in the 1870s, it established itself in the following decade as an independent field of science, although it took a while before preventive strategies or even mass treatments could be deployed against the various diseases whose causes were now identified.”

> “Long before causalities had been scientifically established, experience showed that it was healthier to live in cities with clean water, proper sewers, and organized garbage disposal and street cleaning ”

### Natural Disasters

> “The eruption of Tambora had global consequences. In many parts of Europe and North America, 1815 was the coldest and wettest year since records began, and 1816 went down in the annals as the “year without a summer.” The impact was most severe in New England and western Canada. But Germany, France, the Netherlands, Britain, and Ireland also recorded abnormal weather conditions and poor harvests. For several more years particles in the stratosphere blocked the sun’s rays, causing average temperatures to fall by three to four degrees Celsius. Nowhere did the crisis bite harder than in the southern Rhineland and Switzerland in the winter of 1816–17. Even the basic supply of imported grain broke down, since early frosts and harsh weather delayed shipments from Baltic ports. All of the old syndrome of food shortages, rising prices, and depressed demand for nonagrarian products established its hold. People flocked from crisis areas toward Russia and the Habsburg Empire, or via Dutch ports to the New World. Captains refused to accept penniless refugees, and many who were turned away had to make their way back home as beggars. The acute central European agrarian crisis of 1815–17 has often been seen[…]”

### Famine

> “These countries experienced unusually severe weather conditions at almost the same time, from 1876 to 1879 and from 1896 to 1900–1902. Also Brazil, Java, the Philippines, and northern and southern Africa suffered poor harvests that have since been blamed on the meteorological phenomenon known as El Niño (although this is still disputed). For India and China together, the excess mortality during these years has been estimated at a total of 31 to 59 million.”

> “The claim that eighteenth-century Chinese peasants lived at least as well as and probably better than their counterparts in the France of Louis XV—a claim that people in the West long found beyond belief—has something to be said for it in the state of our present knowledge.”

> “the care and maintenance of its famed system of public grain reserves, which reached its peak of efficiency under the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1737–96), was one of the principal duties of local officials, and the relief it gave in an emergency was several times greater than the tax yield in a normal year. The emperor and provincial governors personally concerned themselves with the functioning of this system. ”

> “When the Opium War then opened a long series of conflicts with the Great Powers, and the Taiping Revolution shortly afterward started a chain of internal revolts, the Qing state began to set new priorities for its dwindling resources. The supply of food to the army would now take precedence over civilian disaster relief. This reorientation contributed to the virtual disappearance of the granary system in the 1860s, a hundred years after the height of its functioning.”

### Agricultural Revolutions

> “in Europe, Russia, and the neo-European overseas societies, total arable land rose by a factor of 1.7—from 255 million hectares in 1860 to 439 million hectares in 1910—which was a rate of growth without precedent in history over a period of five decades”

> “The age-old sickle still cut 90 percent of the wheat harvest in southern England in 1790, being only slowly replaced by the scythe; and around 1900, when the sheaf-binding harvester was the leading technology in England, the scythe was still reaping most of the cereals on the Continent. Steam-powered machines threshed most of the harvest from the 1880s in England, but only much later elsewhere. In 1892 the first tractor went into batch production in the United States, though no more than one thousand were in use in 1914 (one million by 1930). In 1950 horses still accounted for 85 percent of traction in European agriculture.”

### Poverty and Wealth

> “The unique megafortunes in the United States are explained partly by factors such as the size of the internal market, the relatively high starting point for the economy, the wealth of natural resources, and the absence of political or legal obstacles to capitalist development. In addition there were synergistic effects within the industrial system. Rockefeller became a very rich man only after the emergence of the US car industry had presented his oil company with golden opportunities. Agricultural property did not stand behind any of the top American plutocrats, and in Britain too, by the 1880s, it was no longer land but finance, press ownership, or the gold and diamond trade that accounted for the largest fortunes. On the other hand, urban real estate was much in demand as a capital investment.”

> “something else was new. In the 1830s or 1840s, rich people with democratic or even radical political views had existed in the United States under President Jackson, in France during the July Monarchy, in England after the Reform Bill of 1832, and in pre-1848 Germany. But now, by the 1880s at the latest, the classic plutocracy of the fin de siècle had come into being. Political liberalism was largely divided within itself, as wealth virtually implied the representation of moneyed interests by conservative and right-leaning liberal parties. By no means were all the rich and superrich, in either Europe or the United States, vociferous propagandists for conservative values. But “radical plutocrat” had become a contradiction in terms.”

> “In China there had been no hereditary landowning aristocracy before the Manchu conquest of 1644, and large estates had generally been atypical; education more than property had been the qualification for elite membership. One could become prosperous in the state service, but not spectacularly wealthy, and few managed to keep their wealth in the family for many generations.”

> “Some African societies had institutions that provided a poverty net, but others (Christian Ethiopia among them) lacked anything that could be described as such. A precolonial “caring Africa,” with a comprehensive community life, is a romantic myth.”

### Globalized Consumption

> “An absence of begging is very rare in history, and it was probably never attained before the twentieth century. We should bear in mind that in the nineteenth century begging was still seen as a normal part of social existence. It has always been a fairly precise indicator of poverty or even destitution, but also something else: a special kind of parasitic economy, often with a complex (in China even guild-like) organization and usually tolerated within limits by the authorities. The Victorian term “underworld” is here seldom apposite.”

> “The American manioc root became native in areas of Africa under Portuguese influence, and in the last third of the nineteenth century both indigenous and colonial initiatives helped to spread it to many other parts of the continent. Today it is by far the most widespread edible plant in the tropical countries of Africa.”

> “world sugar production doubled between 1880 and 1900, and doubled again between 1900 and 1914. The share of sugar in the average caloric intake of Britons is thought to have increased from 2 percent to 14 percent in the course of the century.”

> “In 1876 beef was sent by refrigerated ship to Europe for the first time, and in the 1880s the new technology made it possible for Argentina and Australasia to export meat in large quantities. After 1900, as more and more of the colossal US output was absorbed by its internal market, Argentina became the world’s largest meat exporter.”

> “The real and lasting boom in Argentine exports to Europe began only in 1907, when American meatpacking companies with better deep-freeze technology took over the trade. It was the first important investment linkup between the United States and Argentina, which until then had belonged more to the British sphere of economic influence. On the other hand, access to the US market continued to be denied to Argentine producers.”

> “The 1880s saw the birth and marketing of the branded product, with strategies planned like military operations. Singer’s sewing machine and Underberg’s herb liqueur in its characteristic bottle were present at the dawn of brand-centered marketing.”

> “Around 1790 the governor-general Lord Cornwallis permitted himself to dine in his shirt sleeves, but two decades later it went without saying that members of the colonial elite should dress correctly for dinner when natives were present, even in intense heat, and in 1830 officials of the East India Company were forbidden to wear Indian clothes in public.”

## The City as Norm and Exception

> “For millennia the “built environment” had consisted essentially of buildings. Now streets were paved, harbors lined with brick, railroad and streetcar tracks laid, street lighting installed, and clinker-clad underground tunnels dug for sewage and subway trains. New structures went downward as well as upward. By the end of the century cities were cleaner and brighter.”

> “Only now did urban land become an investment and an object of speculation, valued not for its agricultural uses but simply because of its location.”

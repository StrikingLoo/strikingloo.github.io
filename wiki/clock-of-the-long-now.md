## Quotes and Excerpts

> “Nobody can save the world, but any of us can help set in motion a self-saving world—if we are willing to engage the processes of centuries, because that is where the real power is.”

### Accelerating Technological Growth

> “What came to be known as Moore’s Law was a small graph and explanation buried in his Electronics paper. From 1965 Moore looked back to the beginnings of integrated circuits in 1959 and noted that the number of components (transistors) that could be fit on a chip had doubled every year for six years. He predicted that the trend would continue for another ten years, permitting an astonishing sixty-five thousand components on a chip by 1975. (The actual numbers by 1975 were around twelve thousand, so the formula was later adjusted to predict doubling every eighteen months.)” <br>Thirty-seven doublings, about a 137 billionfold increase of power in fifty-six years.

> “If taking thought for the future was essential in steady times, how much more important is it in accelerating times, and how much harder? It becomes both crucial and seemingly impossible. There are so many new varieties of short-term opportunity, and the pace of events buffets our attention with so many surprises, it is as if the old dialogue between opportunistic kairos and durational chronos has become a monologue, just a shriek of joy into the gale of freefall.”

### Thinking Long-term
> “After years of working with alcoholics the anthropologist and psychologist Gregory Bateson observed, “If the hangover preceded the binge, drunkenness would be considered a virtue and not a vice.” Drunks disbelieve in the inevitability of the hangover and the harm they cause while drunk. Their vice is dismissing the future and surrendering to the rewards of the moment, the binge. Bateson’s idea of hangover-first would reward and teach patience. The reality of binge-first annihilates both patience and memory.”

> “The destiny of our species is shaped by the imperatives of survival on six distinct time scales. To survive means to compete successfully on all six time scales. But the unit of survival is different at each of the six time scales. On a time scale of years, the unit is the individual. On a time scale of decades, the unit is the family. On a time scale of centuries, the unit is the tribe or nation. On a time scale of millennia, the unit is the culture. On a time scale of tens of millennia, the unit is the species. On a time scale of eons, the unit is the whole web of life on our planet. Every human being is the product of adaptation to the demands of all six time scales. That is why conflicting loyalties are deep in our nature. In order to survive, we have needed to be loyal to ourselves, to our families, to our tribes, to our cultures, to our species, to our planet. If our psychological impulses are complicated, it is because they were shaped by complicated and conflicting demands.” --Freeman Dyson

> “Quiet music stops people talking. It makes people aware that they may be intruding on someone else’s experience if they talk loudly. It slows them down, makes them realize they’re having an experience which exists in time, has duration, and that therefore they might want to stop shuffling around and sit still for a bit to wait for the experience to unfold.”

> “The ingenuity in the Clock is late twentieth century and so are the materials. The process of constructing a prototype Millennial Clock in 1998 led the builders into direct encounters with deep time. The challenge was to build a prototype that not only worked but would keep working for ten thousand years. Exotic materials were sought for maximum longevity and minimal friction: Monel (nickel-copper alloy) and tungsten carbide for hardness, diamond coating for further hardness, Invar alloy for temperature independence, metallic glass for a potentially inexhaustible pendulum ribbon.”

### The Library of Alexandria 

>“The legendary stature of the Library of Alexandria is justifiable. In its prime (290 B.C.E. to 88 B.C.E.) the library was the fount of the Hellenistic Greek Renaissance, and the classics it preserved helped inspire the fifteenth-century European Renaissance. Then the largest city in the world, Alexandria remained the intellectual capital of the Mediterranean for most of the duration of the Roman Empire. The famous library and museum at its peak may have held six hundred thousand scrolls—the equivalent of one hundred twenty thousand modern books. Alexandria’s library was an intensely productive community of writers, translators, editors, historians, mathematicians, astronomers, geographers, and physicians. Its librarians included Apollonius of Rhodes (poet of The Argonauts), Callimachus (the father of bibliography), Eratosthenes (who estimated the diameter of the Earth), Aristarchus of Samos (a Sun-centered Copernican eighteen centuries before Copernicus), and Hipparchus (discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes).”

>“So who burned the Library of Alexandria? War did three times, inadvertently. Religious bigotry did twice, on purpose. We are right to grieve. Only one in ten of the major Greek classics survived. Nothing like Alexandria’s library was seen again for a thousand years.”

> “Starting anew with a clean slate has been one of the most harmful ideas in history. It treats previous knowledge as an impediment and imagines that only present knowledge deployed in theoretical purity can make real the wondrous new vision. Thus the French Revolution of 1789, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949 each made brave new worlds that catastrophically failed. By cutting off continuity with the slower parts of their cultures they had no fallback. The American Revolution of 1776, by contrast, was highly conservative. Its instigators studied Roman, Venetian, and even Iroquois history for precedents. There was little of the brutal rhetoric of making a total break with the past. As a result, all the leaders who started the revolution lived to see it through to completion, and its innovations in governance aged relatively well.”

### Legacy Systems

> “Beyond the evanescence of data formats and digital storage media is a still deeper problem. Large-scale computer systems are at the core of driving corporations, public institutions, and indeed whole sectors of the economy: financial markets, utilities, telecommunications, travel and distribution, health care, and government. Over time these gargantuan systems become dauntingly complex and unknowable as new features are added, old bugs are worked around with layers of “patches,” generations of programmers add new programming tools and styles, and portions of the system are repurposed to take on novel functions. With a mixture of respect and loathing, computer professionals call these monsters legacy systems.” <br><br>“Typically, outdated legacy systems make themselves so essential over the years that no one can contemplate the prolonged trauma of replacing them, and they cannot be fixed completely because the problems are too complexly embedded and there is no one left who understands the whole system. Teasing a new function out of a legacy system is not done by command but by conducting a series of cautious experiments that with luck might converge toward the desired outcome.”

> “What we can do is convert the design of software from brittle to resilient, from heedlessly headlong to responsible, and from time corrupted to time embracing. Achieving each of these qualities is known to be an approximately intractable problem. To be sure none can be solved in a year, but all can yield to decades of focused work if we understand that the health of civilization is at stake.”

### Preserving Digital Media

> “What we can do is convert the design of software from brittle to resilient, from heedlessly headlong to responsible, and from time corrupted to time embracing. Achieving each of these qualities is known to be an approximately intractable problem. To be sure none can be solved in a year, but all can yield to decades of focused work if we understand that the health of civilization is at stake.”

> “The problem of the acceleration of high technology is that its headlong urgency routinely displaces what is important in the long term. Digital industries must shift from being the main source of society’s ever-shortening attention span to becoming a reliable guarantor of long-term perspective. We’ll know the shift has happened when programmers begin to anticipate the Year 10,000 problem and assign five digits instead of four to year dates. “02002,” they’ll write, at first frivolously, then seriously.”

### 10000 Year Library for the Future

> “One canon I would like to see established is that of the great textbooks. Just knowing the current list—The Cell in microbiology, The Art of Computer Programming, Renfrew’s Archaeology—would enable anyone to pursue top-level education on their own. All the best textbooks in combination would nearly add up to Lovelock’s primer of civilization. Study of the evolution of the most influential textbooks over time would yield peerless insight into intellectual history. Comparative analysis of what makes the best contemporary textbooks so good might lead to even better textbooks being written.”

### Predicting the Future

> [About science fiction writers] “Too *little* imagination? Yes, for a structural reason almost never taken into account. At any time the several “probable” things that might occur in the future are vastly outnumbered by the countless near-impossible eventualities, which are so many and individually so unlikely that it is not worth the effort of futurists or futurismists to examine and prepare for even a fraction of them. Yet one of those innumerable near-impossibilities is what is most likely to occur. Reality is thus statistically forced always to be extraordinary. Fiction is not allowed that freedom. Fiction has to be plausible; reality doesn’t.”

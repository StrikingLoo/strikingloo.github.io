> Of course, someone who's better at having ideas than me could've solved the problem without the dead ends, but as we discussed earlier, it's fairly easy to find low hanging fruit on "execution speed" and not so easy to find low hanging fruit on "having better ideas". However, it's possible to, to a limited extent, simulate someone who has better ideas than me by being able to quickly try out and discard ideas (I also work on having better ideas, but I think it makes sense to go after the easier high ROI wins that are available as well). Being able to try out ideas quickly also improves the rate at which I can improve at having better ideas since a key part of that is building intuition by getting feedback on what works.

[Dan Luu - Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity](https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/)

The article in general is a great defense of investing in your execution speed and productivity. If you can remove friction and iterate faster, even if you start from weaker solutions you may reach higher before others. 

This reminds me of [the multistage bean machine](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/order/beanmachine-multistage/index.html) where a process that samples from a Gaussian N times and keeps the highest number will yield far lower returns than one that can sample from a Gaussian N/k times, over k steps, and use the previous sample's maximum as mean each time (single-stage selection increases logarithmically, while multi-stage increases linearly).

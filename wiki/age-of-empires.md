## General Tips from around the Web

- Your population should be about 60% villagers. You're not overproducing
- Always be producing a villager. Then 2 more when you reach castle age and get to build more urban centers
- Explore your area first with the scout, not the entire map. There will be time enough to find enemy bases, first just get all your sheep, find your local gold and stone, and boars and berries.
- Trading early is suboptimal, and here early can mean castle age. Carts are a waste of gold while there is gold on the ground.

## First 15 villagers

- First queue 2 villagers in urban center, and build 2 houses with your initial 3 villagers (2 and 1)
- First 6 villagers gather food as soon as they spawn / finish building, from sheep that your scout found by scouting local area.
- Villagers 7\~10 (next 4 normally) build a lumber mill and start gathering wood. Note that straggler trees will only be felled later on. Note that optimally you will put 2 to work on each side of the lumberjack camp.
- Villager 11 lures a boar, they all kill it and gather from it.
- _You can get away with reaching feudal age without an Agrarian revolution in normal maps_. Villager 12 is a builder. Build a house first, then a mill, beside the berry bushes.
- Get 4 on berries, and now first 15 are done.

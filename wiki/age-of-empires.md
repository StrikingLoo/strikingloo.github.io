## General Tips from around the Web

- Your population should be about 60% villagers. You're not overproducing
- Always be producing a villager. Then 2 more when you reach castle age and get to build more urban centers
- Explore your area first with the scout, not the entire map. There will be time enough to find enemy bases, first just get all your sheep, find your local gold and stone, and boars and berries.
- Trading early is suboptimal, and here early can mean castle age. Carts are a waste of gold while there is gold on the ground.

## First 15 villagers

- First queue 2 villagers in urban center, and build 2 houses with your initial 3 villagers (2 and 1)
- First 6 villagers gather food as soon as they spawn / finish building, from sheep that your scout found by scouting local area.
- Villagers 7\~10 (next 4 normally) build a lumber mill and start gathering wood. Note that straggler trees will only be felled later on. Note that optimally you will put 2 to work on each side of the lumberjack camp.
- Villager 11 lures a boar, they all kill it and gather from it.
- _You can get away with reaching feudal age without an Agrarian revolution in normal maps_. Villager 12 is a builder. Build a house first, then a mill, beside the berry bushes.
- Get 4 on berries, and now first 15 are done.

## Fast Castle Strategy

- Villagers 1 & 2 build a house
- Villager 3 builds another house
- Villagers 1-3 then move to sheep
- Villagers 4-6 also go to sheep
- Villager 7 builds a lumper camp then chops wood
- Villagers 8 & 9 also chop wood at the lumber camp
- Villager 10 builds a house
- Villager 10 then lures a boar and harvests it with the sheep farmers (7 Villagers total harvesting the boar)
- Villagers 11 & 12 chop wood at the lumber camp
- Villager 13 builds a mill at the berries & collects berries
- Villagers 14 & 15 also collect berries
- Villager 16 lures a second boar and harvests with other boar/sheep farmers (8 Villagers total on boar/sheep)
- Villager 17 builds a house
- Villager 17 then collects berries
- Villagers 18 & 19 also collect berries (6 Villagers total collecting berries)
- Villager 20 builds a house
- Villager 20 then builds a second lumber camp & chops wood
- Villagers 21-24 also chop wood at the second lumber camp
- Villager 25 builds a mining camp and mines gold
- Villagers 26 & 27 also mine gold
- Research Feudal Age
- Create a barracks with one lumber camp Villager when youâ€™re approximately 60% of the way to Feudal, then return to chopping wood
- Villagers 28 & 29 mine gold (5 Villagers total mining gold)
- Create a blacksmith and a stable or market using three Villagers from berries
- Research Castle Age
- Research Double-bit Axe at a lumber camp & Horse Collar at your mill

**For Archery rush:**

- While developing feudal, on 40% make house, on 60% barracks
- As soon as Feudal, 2x Archery (with two vills), then blacksmith, Fletching (and eventually the other tech too)

You can complement archers with a few spearmen, skirms on late, and this strategy requires you to commit to gold and wood faster and more strongly.

## Building tips

From [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoBxIUAATEE).

- Wall against early attack with palisade, e.g. against drush. Use minimum possible resources and wall only resource places.
- Don't build defenses until you're attacking, if you're going for a rush.
- Take into account which map you got (we also see a \~11 scout army doing a rush)
- Against rush, especially trush, you build pointing to your TC to lead enemy troops towards it
- Use buildings as walls, especially 3x3 ones like unit production. If you build palisades put your houses before them, or use houses as walls themselves. It is suboptimal for a house to not be a wall!
- Gates have less armor and hp/square than walls.
- Castles need to be on elevated ground for 25% extra damage, but also 1) consider there shouldn't be other elevated ground nearby. It's worse if you're not and they are. 2) Castles make trebs, which are terrific at sieges. One way to attack the enemy is you build a castle near their base, then make trebs. 3) Castles especially elevated can one-shot small fry like xbowman or archers!
- In late you build castles overlooking mines or other resource spots.
- Start building house when you're on pop%3==0, not %5 so your pipeline never stops churning.
- When dropping a resource building, consider defendability and efficiency. You may want to surround building with some palisades. 
- Building camp? Send one villager to build, the rest to gather resources. Each subsequent villager only raises speed by a marginal 30% of what the first one is returning.
- Build forward siege buildings on elevated terrain, so produced units get the bonus and also the building is hard to attack.
- Monks are very valuable. Build monastery close to TC, and you can make monks convert and shift click to garrison.
- Your two extra TC may go one to wood, one to gold/stone. Place TC into resources without camps, for optimality.
- When building farms with multiple villagers, build them all with shift then right click into a single one. This way one farmer goes to each farm, which is optimally fast.

### Fast Castle Build Order 

From [Morley Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae2k3ah1mRA)

- Houses
- 6 sheep
- 4 wood (lumber camp)
- 1 boar
- 1 build 2 houses, then mill and berries
- 4 more to berries (lure second boar with shepherd)
- 2 boar, move 2 vills to farms
- 5 wood (2nd lumber camp)
- 3 gold
- Loom
- Feudal
- Make farms with shepherds (9 farms) while researching

**In Feudal**
- Make market (2 vills) and blacksmith (1 vill) from lumberjack vills.
- 2 wood
- click to castle
- Research double bit axe and horse collar
- As soon as you reach Castle Age, make 2 town centers in relevant resources.

### Archer Rush build order

From [Morley Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4MyN8kpD84)

- Houses
- 6 sheep
- 4 wood (lumber camp)
- 1 boar
- 1 build 2 houses, then mill and berries
- 3 more to berries (lure second boar with shepherd)
- 2 boar
- 5 wood (2nd lumber camp)
- Loom
- Feudal

- **When feudal is 40% done**: Take 3 shepherd vills to mine gold, 1 lumberjack vill to make barracks, also a couple houses.
- **After feudal**: 4 to gold
- Make two ranges (uses gatherer vills)
- Research Double Bit Axe
- Make blacksmith
- Research Fletching
- research Horse Collar
- Starts rushing at 6 archers and one horse.

### Villager Estimations

A villager collects roughly 1 resource every 3 seconds, so e.g. the 800 food for Castle age take 2 minutes to collect if you dedicate 20 villagers to it. In general it takes 3\*F/V seconds for V villagers to collect F food (or any other resource). I think this number is a slight overestimation if the collection point is close, underestimation if it's far.

<div class="post">
  <p>from <strong>Trying</strong> by <a href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">Paul Graham</a></p>

<p>To understand what a real essay is, we have to reach back into history again, though this time not so far. To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of what he called ‚Äúessais.‚Äù He was doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and the difference is embodied in the name. Essayer is the French verb meaning ‚Äúto try‚Äù and an essai is an attempt. <strong>An essay is something you write to try to figure something out.</strong></p>

<p>Figure out what? You don‚Äôt know yet. And so you can‚Äôt begin with a thesis, because you don‚Äôt have one, and may never have one. An essay doesn‚Äôt begin with a statement, but with a question. In a real essay, you don‚Äôt take a position and defend it. You notice a door that‚Äôs ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what‚Äôs inside.</p>

<p>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though? Why not just sit and think? Well, there precisely is Montaigne‚Äôs great discovery. <strong>Expressing ideas helps to form them.</strong> Indeed, helps is far too weak a word. Most of what ends up in my essays I only thought of when I sat down to write them. That‚Äôs why I write them.</p>

<p>In the things you write in school you are, in theory, merely explaining yourself to the reader. In a real essay you‚Äôre writing for yourself. You‚Äôre thinking out loud.</p>

<hr />

<p>From <a href="https://leananki.com/zettelkasten-method-smart-notes/">LeanAnki, Zettelkasten Method</a>, I see he has this simple method for essay writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write about a problem in detail.</li>
  <li>Write about the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course an extra step would be ‚Äòmake sure you include actionable advice‚Äô. I like this approach, it‚Äôs simple and goes straight to the point. I like the way he combines it with note-taking/zettelkastening by linking zettels that have to do with the problem, and others that have to do with the solution.</p>

<p>This could be a way to write essays more freely, without being bound to the tutorial structure.</p>

<hr />

<p>From <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8">Andy Matuschak‚Äôs Executable strategy for writing</a></p>

<h3 id="undirected-strategy">Undirected Strategy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write durable notes continuously while reading and thinking. (Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work)</li>
  <li>Each time you add a note, add a link to it to an outline, creating one if necessary (Create speculative outlines while you write).</li>
  <li>Eventually, you‚Äôll feel excited about fleshing out one of those outlines. (Let ideas and beliefs emerge organically)</li>
  <li>Write new notes to fill in missing pieces of the outline.</li>
  <li>Concatenate all the note texts together to get an initial manuscript</li>
  <li>Rewrite it.</li>
</ul>

<p>As is, it works better with a Zettelkasten kind of note-taking space, but each separate note could be replaced with a new paragraph or header in a big note in a system like this personal wiki. Then I could maintain an ‚Äúoutline‚Äù folder for essays-to-be, where they could grow organically. This may start with my small ‚Äòhow to make a static site and host it on the web‚Äô and grow slowly from there, as a growing place for posts before I publish them on my actual blog (or on this site‚Äôs blog, I guess).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>From <a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-truth-of-fact-the-truth-of-feeling-by-ted-chiang-subterranean-press">Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling</a></strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúWriting was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn‚Äôt if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.‚Äù</p>

<p>I love the idea of thoughts becoming persistent vs a thing that fades with human memory, and how that shaped future developments in history.</p>

<p>There is the sensation when writing a long piece, especially of non-fiction but I guess also in a novel, of moving around chapters, sections or paragraphs like they are self-supporting objects.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that we exercise a certain level of abstraction when dealing with a portion of a written text that is very similar to that which we apply to a method, class or module when we would restructure a big software project.</p>

<p>That is, being able to say ‚ÄòI will move the chapter on X nearer to the end, before the conclusion‚Äô instead of having to hold the whole context and information of that chapter in your head to make the decision, is similar to knowing a certain function maps inputs to outputs in a way, without having to remember its exact implementation when deciding how to use it or where to put it.</p>

<p><strong>From <a href="http://matt.might.net/#blog">Matt Might‚Äôs blog</a></strong></p>

<p>‚Äù The secret to low-cost academic blogging is to make blogging a natural byproduct of all the things that academics already do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing an interesting lecture? Put your lecture notes in a blog post.</li>
  <li>Writing a detailed email reply? ‚ÄúReply to public‚Äù with a blog post.</li>
  <li>Answering the same question a second time? Put it in a blog post.</li>
  <li>Writing interesting code? Comment a snippet into a post.</li>
  <li>Doing something geeky at home? Blog about what you learned.
‚Äú</li>
</ul>

<p>From <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1">The ZettelKasten Method, LessWrong</a></p>

<p>‚ÄúThis idea of jotting down ideas while you‚Äôre out and about is very important. If you feel you don‚Äôt have enough ideas (be it for research, for writing fiction, for art ‚Äì whatever) my first question would be whether you have a good way to jot down little ideas as they occur to you.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="what-is-what-could-be-call-to-action">What is, what could be, call-to-action</h3>

<p>This is the story structure behind every TED talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Act I: What is</li>
  <li>Act II: What could be.</li>
  <li>Act III: The call to action.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can build this story arc in different lengths for different settings: the elevator pitch, the 15 minute explanation, the 1hr story.</p>

<h2 id="public-narrative">Public Narrative</h2>

<p>The public narrative has three steps, and is used a lot in speeches both in industry and Politics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The me part: talk about yourself.</li>
  <li>The us part: talk about shared values and your listener.</li>
  <li>The action part: a call to action appealing to shared values.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI used to misunderstand writing too, and my style suffered severely as a result.‚Äù - Soliman Writes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author begins by pointing out writing is not just making a sequence of words, and describing how many knowledge workers ‚Äòexpose their thought process‚Äô by how poorly they wrote.</p>

<p>He lists misconceptions about writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Writing only when told.</strong> <em>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing it because you‚Äôre wrestling with a matter ‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôre (‚Ä¶) learning about something you deeply care about. Surprisingly, I realized you often get rewarded for writing willingly.‚Äù</em></li>
  <li><strong>Writing only to document</strong>: <em>‚Äúthere‚Äôs a big difference between actually writing and merely producing text. (‚Ä¶) Text producers don‚Äôt add to the conversation. They don‚Äôt write to generate ideas, but to record existing ones.‚Äù</em> <em>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I used to write: coming up with new ways of looking at things wasn‚Äôt the goal.‚Äù</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚ÄúA book stirred something in you? Go beyond highlighting paragraphs and write new ones. Instead of inertly listening to ideas, participate with your own. Make it a point to write only to create, rather than writing only to document.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tom-critchlow-on-youre-not-blogging-and-thats-a-problem">Tom Critchlow on ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Blogging and that‚Äôs a Problem‚Äù</h3>

<p>‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the lesson here? <strong>Blog on topics you‚Äôre thinking about - but remember you don‚Äôt need to finish the thought to put the post live.</strong></p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my best trick for writing blog posts. It‚Äôs simple: <strong>write a blog post, think about who cares about that topic, email it to them asking for their thoughts.</strong></p>

<p>Could be an old boss, a friend, someone you met at a conference - it doesn‚Äôt matter. Write something they‚Äôd find interesting and email them a thoughtful email. Don‚Äôt send more than 5 of these per blog post.</p>

<p>it‚Äôs a great routine to get into because it <strong>forces you to write a blog post so that at least one person cares about it.</strong>‚Äù</p>

<hr />
<p>When writing a textbook: start with the cool stuff! Explain later.</p>

<h3 id="advice-from-monica-lents-blogging-newsletter">Advice from Monica Lent‚Äôs Blogging Newsletter</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain an idea log</li>
  <li>Determine the best medium (social media vs. search). Social media is for funny, relatable or inspirational content. Google will drive traffic to content like tutorials on how to solve a problem, and informational content.</li>
  <li>Do keyword research</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thesephists-how-i-write">TheSephist‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow I Write‚Äù</h3>

<p>Notes from <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/how-i-write/">How I Write, by @theSephist</a>.</p>

<p>Usually, idea ‚Äúsparks‚Äù are things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An analogy I think is interesting</li>
  <li>An underappreciated trend in the world / industry</li>
  <li>A technical topic I want to deep-dive</li>
  <li>A new approach / perspective to an established problem</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äù[I will] keep it in my mental periphery so that the idea has the time and space to grow and snowball into something more interesting and meaty.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then goes on to discuss ‚Äòexpression callibration‚Äô, where he will usually collect material surrounding the idea he wants to write about (taking notes of relevant links, etc.) to then expand upon the topic and add adjacent ideas to it. He also discusses the idea and his thoughts on it with multiple smart people, to find the best fitting words to express it, the appropriate order for different points, and this way he can start thinking of a prototype of how he would write it down.</p>

<p>He writes an outline: a list of ideas in the order he wants to write about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe rest is pretty straightforward drafting. I‚Äôll just sit down and crank it out. At this point, if I‚Äôve done my job right, it feels less like writing from scratch and more like filling in the blanks and expanding on existing ideas, because I‚Äôve already figured out which topics I want to talk about, in what order, in what specific way, and I‚Äôve marked it on my doc with headings.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach to writing reminds me of the difference between generating text with an autoregressive <a href="/wiki/deep-learning-NLP#transformers">transformer</a> versus using <a href="/wiki/diffusion-LM">diffusion-LM</a>: In one you write one word/token at a time and can only look back, what‚Äôs written is written. In the other you roughly define how long your text is going to be, you start with a very noisy representation and polish it iteratively until you have a final product.</p>

<p>He mentions a thing that really contributes to his writing is: ‚ÄúInvesting more time <strong>thinking about how to communicate an idea</strong>, rather than just settling on the first expression of it I think of‚Äù. I wonder if thinking of 3~5 ways to restate the main ideas of a post may help it sound better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe that someone who has been well-educated will think of something worth writing at least once a week; to a surprising extent, this has been true. (I added ~130 documents to this repository over the first 3 years.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am attempting to explain things to my future self, who is intelligent and interested, but has forgotten. What I am doing is explaining why I decided what I did to myself and noting down everything I found interesting about it for future reference. I hope my other readers, whomever they may be, might find the topic as interesting as I found it, and the essay useful or at least entertaining‚Äìbut the intended audience is my future self.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my personal interests is applying the idea of the Long Now. What and how do you write a personal site with the long-term in mind? We live most of our lives in the future, and the actuarial tables give me until the 2070‚Äì2080s.(‚Ä¶) It is a common-place in science fiction that longevity would cause widespread risk aversion. But on the other hand, it could do the opposite: the longer you live, the more long-shots you can afford to invest in. Someone with a timespan of 70 years has reason to protect against black swans‚Äîbut also time to look for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful‚Äîif one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself. (Even experienced professionals can only write at their peak for a few hours a day).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As he writes more, the writing/research process becomes autocatalytic. He:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internalizes a habit of noticing interesting questions that flit accross his brain.</li>
  <li>Writes down useful links or quotes so they ‚Äòslowly accrete‚Äô.</li>
  <li>Learns to use new tools that give power to his writing.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I originally used last file modification time but this turned out to be confusing to readers, because I so regularly add or update links or add new formatting features that the file modification time was usually quite recent, and so it was meaningless.</p>

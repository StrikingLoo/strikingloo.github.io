description: "A book about otaku subculture from a postmodern viewpoint, written around the turn of the century."
abstract: "I gave this book a shot as it was recommended by the Youtuber Hazel. I strongly disliked it. Too postmodern for me, many terms are thrown around and used as if they had deep meaning but are never properly defined, so you have to go off vibes. Then there is lots of pattern matching to these loosely defined ideas, to the point where they could fit many different scenarios, but these multiple interpretations are treated as something deep or meaningful instead of random rearrangements of phenomena to fit a theory's scaffolding. A few discussions on otaku history were moderately interesting but all in all the book did not feel worth reading, with its biggest saving grace being its brevity. I cannot say I am leaving this book better informed, having gained any insights or changed my mind about anything."

> “In this book, I focused on the “otaku” —a subculture that emerged in Japan in the 1970s and gave rise to a massive entertainment industry producing manga, anime, and video games. By understanding its history through the notion of “postmodernity,” I wanted to analyze the psychological structure of contemporary Japan. This book was published in Japanese in 2001, and it held particularly strong influence for young readers interested in contemporary society and subculture. ”

> "to explore the psychological structure of the age through a brief history of subcultural products such as manga, anime, and video games"

> "For Azuma, this new era witnessed a new mode of animalized consumer behavior wherein consumption is driven by satiable cravings rather than human desires that could be neither fulfilled nor quenched."

> "On the other hand, a completely opposite position also exists. It is not widely known that, since the 1990s, a certain generation of otaku have come to use the term in a highly positive light. The severe otaku - bashing in the press in the wake of the Miyazaki incident incited a reverse reaction from otaku themselves, who have now become hyperconscious of their identity as otaku. "

> "I wish to offer my thesis—that the essence of our era (postmodernity) is extremely well disclosed in the structure of otaku culture—merely as a tool for them to come to terms with the world and comprehend it from their respective positions."

> "These three generations can be divided in the following way.
The first generation centers on those who were born around 1960
and saw Space Battleship Yamato (Uchuusenkan Yamato, Matsumoto Reiji, 1974) and Mobile Suit Gundam (Kido¯ senshi Gandamu, Tomino Yoshi -
yuki, 1979) during their teen years."

> "The second generation is made up
of those who were born around 1970 and, during their teens, enjoyed The Otaku’s Pseudo-Japan
the diversified and matured otaku culture produced by the preceding
generation."

> "The third generation consists of those who were born
around 1980 and were junior high school students at the time of the
Neon Genesis Evangelion boom. The interests of each of these groups
differ slightly."

> "I absolutely do not
perceive the emergence of otaku culture as a uniquely Japanese phenomenon. Rather, I think that it should be grasped as one manifestation in Japan of a grand trend toward the postmodernization of culture
that began in the middle of the twentieth century"

> "While the term “otaku” was not broadly recognized until 1989, otaku
became conscious of themselves as a group, and the previously mentioned pseudo -Japanese imaginary came to draw wide-ranging support,
from the 1970s to the 1980s."

> postmodernism is a different concept from the previously discussed concept of postmodernity. The terms “postmodernity” or the “postmodern” here refer broadly to cultural conditions since the 1970s. Postmodernism, on the other hand, is a much narrower phrase pointing to a particular theoretical position (hence the suffix -ism). Suffice it to note that during the postmodern era a number of individual theories appeared, one of which is that body of thought that has been dubbed “postmodernism.”

> Kojève is known for ascertaining two different types of possible social formation in the postmodern era: the animalization of society as seen in the U.S. model and the spread of snobbery as illustrated in the Japanese model. In this regard, Kojève is oddly sympathetic toward Japan, and he predicts that the Japanization (or snobbery) of Westerners will prevail over Americanization (or animalization). In the eyes of Japanese in the 1980s, the prosperity of the times no doubt signified that we were heading toward the realization of this prospect. Phrased another way, the prosperity of the 1980s enabled Japanese society to forget superficially the existence of its complex toward the United States, which we have examined. “Now the United States has been defeated! We no longer have to speak about the penetration of Americanism in Japan but rather must consider the advancement of Japanism in America!” The rise of postmodernism as an intellectual fad was supported by a climate that produced such claims.

### The Propagation of Simulacra (existence of derivative works like doujinshi)

> "Moreover, from the beginning the sense of realism in otaku genres has been weak; in many cases, even original works create worlds through citation and imitation of previous works. Without reference to the real world, the original is produced as a simulacrum of preceding works from the start, and in turn the simulacrum of that simulacrum is propagated by fan activities and consumed voraciously. In other words, irrespective of their having been created by an author (in the modern sense), the products of otaku culture are born into a chain of infinite imitations and piracy."

### The Decline of the Grand Narrative

> "Otaku shut themselves into the hobby community not because they deny sociality but rather because, as social values and standards are already dysfunctional, they feel a pressing need to construct alternative values and standards."

> "This is a postmodern characteristic because the process by which the coexistence of countless smaller standards replace the loss of the singular and vast social standard corresponds precisely to the “decline Database Animals of the grand narrative” first identified by the French philosopher Jean - François Lyotard."

> "The younger generations that grew up within the postmodern world image imagine the world as a database from the beginning, since they do not need a perspective on the entire world that surveys all—that is to say, they have no need for forgeries, even as a subculture. And if this is the case, in the shift from the generation that needed fiction as a substitute for lost grand narratives to the generation that consumes fictions without such a need—even though they are two parts of the same otaku culture—then a grand transformation is realized in their forms of expression and consumption."

> "Compared with the 1980s otaku, those of the 1990s generally adhered to the data and facts of the fictional worlds and were altogether unconcerned with a meaning and message that might have been communicated. Independently and without relation to an original narrative, consumers in the 1990s consumed only such fragmentary illustrations or settings; and this different type of consumption appeared when the individual consumer empathy toward these fragments strengthened."

> "Neither literature nor entertainment, the otaku novels are already being sold and consumed according to a logic similar to that of video games and illustrations. Commercially speaking, the change from naturalist realism to “anime/ manga-like realism” is sustained by this change in the market. As far as I know, Seiryo¯in is the author who reacted to this change most responsively and changed how he writes novels most fundamentally. Here, it is neither reality (naturalism) or an earlier fiction (narrative consumption) but the database of moe-elements that is felt as most real."

> "in postmodernity, how do simulacra increase? The surface outer layer of otaku culture is covered with simulacra, or derivative works. But in the deep inner layer lies the database of settings and characters, and further down, the database of moe-elements. The consumer behavior of the otaku, which might seem like a chaotic inundation of simulacra, becomes more ordered and understandable once we turn our eyes to the level of the database."

[Scavenger144](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/754kez/how_to_create_a_dungeon_crawl/) on how to create a Dungeon.
- Try to include a variety of environments. You could have a subterranean crypt that opens into a beautiful garden full of the deceased's favorite flowers, only for the dark grind to continue downwards after crossing a corridor.
- If your dungeon is particularly large, break it into wings. Add themes and subplots to each wing, and you can finish each session on a different section of the dungeon.
- Include opportunities to role play. NPCs, abandoned damsels in distress, angry ghosts, confused extraplanar creatures.
- Not every room needs a significant encounter. Use dungeon dressing to telegraph future threats or share world building. Use all the senses. Foreshadow future challenges: a charred corpse reveals a lot.
- Track time. Time moves forward every time a check fails. Make it clear that events will happen as time passes. It helps make your dungeon feel alive.
- A one-page dungeon of five rooms with three monster encounters, a trap, a hazard and a puzzle or secret makes a good one-shot adventure location for a couple of hours of play.

Include a **secret**. A secret could be a hidden monster that has a way to be avoided, hidden treasure or a hidden chamber or room such that accessing it requires secret information (a spell, password, item, etc.).
This information could be scattered through the dungeon, or acquired through negotiation with a different NPC.

A trap that immobilises characters via adhesive or magic, for example, and sounds an alarm to alert monsters, creates a more interesting scenario than knocking off hit points. Monsters should work in tandem with traps; itâ€™s their home turf advantage.

## Dungeon Crawl Builder

### Dungeon History
- Who built this dungeon and for what purpose?
- How did it come to ruin?
- What faction/s occupies/y the dungeon now, and why?
- Why are players visiting it now?

### Dungeon Look
- What is unique about the entrance?
- How is the dungeon history evident in different layered themes?

### Dungeon Challenges
- Combat, boss-fight, maze, riddles and puzzles, social, trap, travel, sneak. Choose 2 or 3.

> **Good illumination and a view of natural beauty** aren't just pleasant luxuries, but can make **important practical differences in your life.**

Light, especially daylight, has a strong effect on mood. There are at least fifteen controlled studies showing that **bright light reduces symptoms of seasonal and nonseasonal depression by about 10-20% over placebo.** This is about equal benefit to some antidepressant drugs, and sufficient that light therapy is a recognized medical treatment for depression. Bright light leads to self-reported better mood even in subjects without a diagnosis of depression, and also leads to better sleep and more agreeable social interactions.

Light and nature have positive effects on health. Some of the most compelling data comes from hospitals, which have long realized that their **patients near windows do better than their more interior counterparts.** In one study, surgical patients near windows recovered faster (7.9 vs. 8.7 days), received fewer negative comments from nurses (1.1 vs. 4 notes), and needed fewer strong painkillers (1 vs. 2.5 doses) than matched controls without a view. Other studies have compared recovery of physiological indicators of stress (for example, blood pressure) in subjects viewing natural or artificial scenes; the subjects with views of nature consistently have healthier stress reactions."

17 children 7 to 12 years old professionally diagnosed with ADHD experienced each of three environments-a city park and two other well-kept urban settings-via individually guided 20-minute walks. Environments were experienced 1 week apart, with randomized assignment to treatment order. After each walk, concentration was measured using Digit Span Backwardsâ€¦Children with ADHD concentrated better after the walk in the park than after the downtown walk (p=.0229) or the neighborhood walk (p=.0072). **Effect sizes were substantial (d=.52 and .77, respectively)** and comparable to those reported for recent formulations of methylphenidate."

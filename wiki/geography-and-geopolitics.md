## The Amu Darya River

The Amu Darya River starts at Tajikistan and goes through Afghanistan, before passing through Uzbekistan into the Aral sea. Of note is a big canal that diverts a considerable share of its volume into Turkmenistan for irrigation. Both Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are big cotton exporters, some of the largest in the world, and they get the lion's share of their water from this river. 

However, Afghanistan upstream wants to divert its flow for their own irrigation canal, which some consider could represent an existential threat for both downstream countries and lead to war.

Due to lack of a qualified workforce, the canal could have an efficiency as low as 50\%, which some experts estimate would lead to a halving of the volume of water that reaches Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

The video also mentions conflicts Afghanistan is going through as of 2024:

- Conflict with Pakistan over the Pashtun-majority areas and the Duran line
- Conflict with Tajikistan as there are more ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan than in Tajikistan but they are not part of the Taliban
- ISIS-K, a terrorist organization that oposes the Taliban and could spark civil war if they attempt to depose them, or invite other countries to a new invasion if they anger them enough with a major international incident -e.g. attacks on Russian civilian population in 2023-.
- A war with the neighboring countries to the north due to water scarcity.

### Values for *rel* attribute in anchor tags.

- *rel="noopener"* you use on all links opening in new tabs using the target *_blank*. There are security implications if you donâ€™t use the *noopener* value on your links opening in new tabs. A malicious attacker can use the window.opener object to change the content and location of the originating page.
- *rel="noreferrer"* can serve a similar purpose as the *noopener*, especially in older browsers. Hence, it makes sense to use them both. Additionally, *noreferrer* can affect your analytics and report traffic as **direct instead of referral**.
- *rel="nofollow"* will inform search engines **not to pass the link juice** to the linked page, and it will not pass PageRank. You can consider it as a value that is used when you want to link to another page but without "endorsing" it. It is the only rel value with a tangible effect on SEO efforts.
